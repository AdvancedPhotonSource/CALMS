Protein Structure May Lead to Treatment for Infection Targeting Cystic Fibrosis Patients

Researchers using the Structural Biology Center 19-ID beamline at the APS have determined the structure of a key protein believed to play a role in a deadly infection that afflicts the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. This finding may lead to a new drug to treat the bacterial infection.
