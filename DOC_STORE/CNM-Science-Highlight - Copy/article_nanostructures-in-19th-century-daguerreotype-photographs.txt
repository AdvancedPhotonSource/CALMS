Nanostructures in 19th Century Daguerreotype Photographs

August 1, 2013

Researchers from the Smithsonian Institution, led by Edward Vicenzi, are teaming up with scientists from Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) and Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) to examine degradation of 19th century Daguerreotype photographs at the nanoscale level. Scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy has been exploited at the APS/CNM Hard X-Ray Nanoprobe facility by Ed Vincenzi (APS) and Volker Rose (CNM’s X-Ray Microscopy Group) and their colleagues.
