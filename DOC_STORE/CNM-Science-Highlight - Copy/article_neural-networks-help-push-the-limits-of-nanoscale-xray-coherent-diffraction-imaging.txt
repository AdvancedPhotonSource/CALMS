Neural networks help push the limits of nanoscale X-ray coherent diffraction imaging

September 14, 2020

In a study published in Applied Physics Letters, researchers develop a fast, dose-efficient, high-resolution method for AI-enabled scanning coherent imaging.

PtychoNN learns to predict the sample amplitude and phase from nano-focused X-ray scanning data.

Scientific Achievement

Development of an AI-enabled scanning coherent imaging method (PtychoNN) was demonstrated to be fast, dose efficient and capable of high resolution.

Significance and Impact

This approach relieves key computational challenges faced by ptychographic X-ray phase retrieval methods, and it is 100x faster with 20% the data.

Research Details

Ptychographic image reconstruction of nano-focused X-ray scattering data was partially replaced with a deep convolutional neural network (PtychoNN).

PtychoNN learned to predict sample amplitude and phase in a single step from the raw coherent imaging data alone.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source.

About the Advanced Photon Source

The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the world’s most productive X-ray light source facilities. The APS provides high-brightness X-ray beams to a diverse community of researchers in materials science, chemistry, condensed matter physics, the life and environmental sciences, and applied research. These X-rays are ideally suited for explorations of materials and biological structures; elemental distribution; chemical, magnetic, electronic states; and a wide range of technologically important engineering systems from batteries to fuel injector sprays, all of which are the foundations of our nation’s economic, technological, and physical well-being. Each year, more than 5,000 researchers use the APS to produce over 2,000 publications detailing impactful discoveries, and solve more vital biological protein structures than users of any other X-ray light source research facility. APS scientists and engineers innovate technology that is at the heart of advancing accelerator and light-source operations. This includes the insertion devices that produce extreme-brightness X-rays prized by researchers, lenses that focus the X-rays down to a few nanometers, instrumentation that maximizes the way the X-rays interact with samples being studied, and software that gathers and manages the massive quantity of data resulting from discovery research at the APS.

This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline. Argonne researchers work closely with researchers from hundreds of companies, universities, and federal, state and municipal agencies to help them solve their specific problems, advance America’s scientific leadership and prepare the nation for a better future. With employees from more than 60 nations, Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. For more information, visit https://​ener​gy​.gov/​s​c​ience.
