Ferroelectric domain wall motion in freestanding single-crystal complex oxide thin films

January 13, 2020

In a study published in Advanced Materials, researchers used microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the energy landscape of ferroelectric materials and the relationship between their electronic and structural orders.

The flip layer transfer (top) was shown to induce unique PZT domain kinetics correlated with a static nanoscale flexoelectric structure (bottom).

 Achievement

Ferroelectric domain wall kinetics of free-standing PZT films were found to be orders of magnitude slower than when bonded to a growth substrate.

Significance and Impact

The observation of unique domain wall kinetics was correlated with mesoscale structural ripples but found to be distinct from a simple release of epitaxial strain - suggesting new routes for structural control of flexoelectric ordering in complex oxides.

Research Details

This unique energy landscape for domain wall motion was observed after layer transfer by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM).

The structural origins of these kinetics were shown to be flexoelectricity induced by a nanoscale spatial distribution of lattice tilts imaged at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)/Advanced Photon Source (APS) Hard X-ray Nanoprobe.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.

About the Advanced Photon Source

The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the world’s most productive X-ray light source facilities. The APS provides high-brightness X-ray beams to a diverse community of researchers in materials science, chemistry, condensed matter physics, the life and environmental sciences, and applied research. These X-rays are ideally suited for explorations of materials and biological structures; elemental distribution; chemical, magnetic, electronic states; and a wide range of technologically important engineering systems from batteries to fuel injector sprays, all of which are the foundations of our nation’s economic, technological, and physical well-being. Each year, more than 5,000 researchers use the APS to produce over 2,000 publications detailing impactful discoveries, and solve more vital biological protein structures than users of any other X-ray light source research facility. APS scientists and engineers innovate technology that is at the heart of advancing accelerator and light-source operations. This includes the insertion devices that produce extreme-brightness X-rays prized by researchers, lenses that focus the X-rays down to a few nanometers, instrumentation that maximizes the way the X-rays interact with samples being studied, and software that gathers and manages the massive quantity of data resulting from discovery research at the APS.

This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline. Argonne researchers work closely with researchers from hundreds of companies, universities, and federal, state and municipal agencies to help them solve their specific problems, advance America’s scientific leadership and prepare the nation for a better future. With employees from more than 60 nations, Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. For more information, visit https://​ener​gy​.gov/​s​c​ience.
