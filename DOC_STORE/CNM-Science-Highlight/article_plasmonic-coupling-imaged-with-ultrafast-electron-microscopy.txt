Plasmonic coupling imaged with ultrafast electron microscopy

July 9, 2021

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers used ultrafast electron microscopy to probe material dynamics at the nanoscale.

Schematic of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) in UEM. The fundamental output from a femtosecond laser is split into two beams. One is used to excite the cathode to create electron photoemission, which is critical to working as a UEM. The other is used to photo-excite the sample.

Scientific Achievement

Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) was used to image local plasmonic coupling between single gold nanocapsules and graphene step edges at the nanometer scale.

Significance and Impact

An understanding of the plasmonic coupling mechanism in these hybrid systems is of vital importance to their applications for optoelectronics, surface enhanced scattering, biosensing and quantum information.

Research Details

Experiments were carried out on the newly established UEM at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Results indicate the proximity of a step in the graphene to the nanocapsule causes asymmetric surface charge density at the ends of the nanocapsules.

Work was performed in part at the CNM.
