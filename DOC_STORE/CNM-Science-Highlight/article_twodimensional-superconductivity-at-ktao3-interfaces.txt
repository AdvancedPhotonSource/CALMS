Two-dimensional superconductivity at KTaO3 interfaces

February 8, 2021

In a study published in Science, researchers discovered the unconventional quantum state of two-dimensional superconductivity at selected interfaces of KTaO3 with EuO or LaAlO3.

Cross-sectional STEM images of EuO/KTaO₃ (111) & LaAlO₃/KTaO₃ (111) interfaces.

Scientific Achievement 

Two-dimensional superconductivity was discovered at selected interfaces between (111) oriented KTaO3 and EuO or LaAlO3 insulating overlayers. Spontaneous in-plane transport anisotropy suggests the emergence of a new ​“stripe” phase. 

Significance and Impact

The superconducting transition temperature observed is an order of magnitude higher than for other metal oxide superconductors. The unique interfacial electronic structure allows unconventional quantum states to emerge.
