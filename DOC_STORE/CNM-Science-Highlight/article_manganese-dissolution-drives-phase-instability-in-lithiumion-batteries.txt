Manganese dissolution drives phase instability in lithium-ion batteries

March 9, 2020

In a study published in Nature, researchers investigated capacity fading mechanisms in cathodes. The findings will inform the development of longer lasting lithium ion batteries.

Scientific Achievement

A correlation is shown between capacity fading and the stability of LiMn2O4 cathodes in lithium ion batteries. Fast manganese (Mn) dissolution triggers irreversible structural evolution and forms a detrimental cycle that constantly consumes active cathode components.

Significance and Impact

These findings close the loop of understanding capacity fading mechanisms and allow for development of longer life lithium ion batteries.

Research Details

Design, synthesis and testing were performed in Argonne’s Chemical Sciences and Engineering division; HEXRD and XANES were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).

Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with EELS was performed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Mn(III) dis-proportionation and Jahn-Teller distortion are determined as drivers of the irreversible phase transitions.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
