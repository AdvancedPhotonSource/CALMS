Manganese dissolution drives phase instability in lithium-ion batteries

March 9, 2020

In a study published in Nature, researchers investigated capacity fading mechanisms in cathodes. The findings will inform the development of longer lasting lithium ion batteries.

HRTEM image of a representative crack formation due to Mn dissolution. Typical EELS spectra of O K-edges and Mn L-edges show the decrease in Mn valence from bulk to crack.

Scientific Achievement

A correlation is shown between capacity fading and the stability of LiMn2O4 cathodes in lithium ion batteries. Fast manganese (Mn) dissolution triggers irreversible structural evolution and forms a detrimental cycle that constantly consumes active cathode components.

Significance and Impact

These findings close the loop of understanding capacity fading mechanisms and allow for development of longer life lithium ion batteries.

Research Details

Design, synthesis and testing were performed in Argonne’s Chemical Sciences and Engineering division; HEXRD and XANES were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).

Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with EELS was performed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Mn(III) dis-proportionation and Jahn-Teller distortion are determined as drivers of the irreversible phase transitions.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.

About the Advanced Photon Source

The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the world’s most productive X-ray light source facilities. The APS provides high-brightness X-ray beams to a diverse community of researchers in materials science, chemistry, condensed matter physics, the life and environmental sciences, and applied research. These X-rays are ideally suited for explorations of materials and biological structures; elemental distribution; chemical, magnetic, electronic states; and a wide range of technologically important engineering systems from batteries to fuel injector sprays, all of which are the foundations of our nation’s economic, technological, and physical well-being. Each year, more than 5,000 researchers use the APS to produce over 2,000 publications detailing impactful discoveries, and solve more vital biological protein structures than users of any other X-ray light source research facility. APS scientists and engineers innovate technology that is at the heart of advancing accelerator and light-source operations. This includes the insertion devices that produce extreme-brightness X-rays prized by researchers, lenses that focus the X-rays down to a few nanometers, instrumentation that maximizes the way the X-rays interact with samples being studied, and software that gathers and manages the massive quantity of data resulting from discovery research at the APS.

This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline. Argonne researchers work closely with researchers from hundreds of companies, universities, and federal, state and municipal agencies to help them solve their specific problems, advance America’s scientific leadership and prepare the nation for a better future. With employees from more than 60 nations, Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. For more information, visit https://​ener​gy​.gov/​s​c​ience.
