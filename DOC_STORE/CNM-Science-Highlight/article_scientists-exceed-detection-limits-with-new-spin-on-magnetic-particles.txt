Scientists exceed detection limits with new spin on magnetic particles

July 9, 2018

In a recent study published in Nanoscale, researchers show that an irreversible transition between strongly non-collinear and single domain states translate into a nonlinear magnetic response that enables ultrasensitive detection.

Scientific Achievement

We introduce magnetic disks with engineered properties that enhance remote detection capabilities of magnetic particle imaging far beyond what is currently available using iron oxide nanoparticles.

Significance and Impact

Engineering properties of magnetic disks can boost noise-free detection of magnetic tags in high background environments for applications ranging from biosensing and medical imaging to anti-counterfeit technologies.

Research Details

Optical lithography and magnetron sputtering were used to create disk-shaped magnetic dots, with some variations in method depending on sample use (in vivo or ex vivo).

Center for Nanoscale Materials resources used include optical lithography, clean room and fabrication, wet chemistry, and post-fabrication processing (lift-off).
