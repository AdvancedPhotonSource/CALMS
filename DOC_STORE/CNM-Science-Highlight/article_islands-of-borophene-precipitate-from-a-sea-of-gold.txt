Islands of borophene precipitate from a sea of gold

July 8, 2019

In a recent study published in ACS Nano, researchers found that spectroscopic measurements reveal that borophene grown on Au(111) possesses a metallic electronic structure.

(a) STM image of a clean Au(111) surface that shows the herringbone reconstruction (V = −1.5 V, I = 100 pA). (b) Following boron deposition at 550 °C, the herringbone reconstruction is modified to a trigonal network, where nanoscale borophene islands (one highlighted by a white dashed line) emerge at the nodes resulting in templated growth across the surface (V = −0.1 V, I = 200 pA).

Scientific Achievement

Borophene, a 2D allotrope of boron recently discovered at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), was synthesized for the first time on a Au(111) surface and characterized using ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Significance and Impact

Expanding the synthesis of boron to other substrates increases the versatility of borophene and furthers understanding of growth dynamics that impacts the field of 2D materials. Borophene exhibits the same two predominate growth modes as its more popular cousin, graphene. 

Research Details

Boron dissolves into the Au(111) substrate at high temperatures and then segregates into borophene sheets at the surface during cooling. UHV STM was performed at CNM.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
