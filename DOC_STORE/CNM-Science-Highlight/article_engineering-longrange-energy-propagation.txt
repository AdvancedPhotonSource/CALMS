Scientific Achievement

Achieving energy propagation beyond tens of micrometers is possible with hybrid plasmonic systems. Long-range optical energy propagation (around 600 µm) was demonstrated via photonic modes engineered by the strong coupling of excitons in compact semiconductor dot layers with surface lattice resonances in metal nanoparticle arrays.

Significance and Impact

Results from this research have potential applications in optoelectronics, sensing and quantum information science.

Research Details

Photoluminescence measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrated long-range energy propagation generated by the hybrid nanophotonic device shown in the image.

The visible and near-infrared microscope at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) was used.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
