Pushing past the limits: nanoimaging and control of resistive switching in VO2

December 10, 2020

In a study published in Small, researchers demonstrated control of a metal-insulator switching device.

Nano-SXDM data was used to spatially identify local phase composition within grain morphology and lattice disorder driven by operando current flow and annealing in a prototype nanodevice structure.

Scientific Achievement

Control of the local metal-insulator switching response in a vanadia (VO2) resistive device through nanoscale defect migration was demonstrated.

Significance and Impact

This in-situ observation of the role of structural disorder and percolation in the formation of persistent switching behavior suggests new routes for structural control of electronic transport in memristive and neuromorphic technologies.

Research Details

Nanoscale Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy (SXDM) at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)/Advanced Photon Source (APS) Hard X-ray Nanoprobe was used to simultaneously determine operando phase fractionation and crystal lattice disorder in response to current induced switching.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
