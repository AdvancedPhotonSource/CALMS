Scientific Achievement

A lithium-air battery based on Li2O formation was designed and tested in cells for 1000 cycles at room temperature. The main new component is a solid electrolyte based on Li10GeP2S12 nanoparticles embedded in a modified polyethylene oxide polymer matrix.

Significance and Impact

Operating with oxygen supplied by the air, this lithium –air battery can theoretically deliver an energy density comparable to that of gasoline. This is four times the density of common lithium-ion batteries. This newer safer battery can provide a longer driving range that could one day power cars, airplanes, and trucks.

Research Details

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the discharged cathode product indicated some Mo3P nanoparticles with amorphous film (10 to 20 nm thick), presumably the LiO2/Li2O2/Li2O observed by the Raman mapping.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials, a DOE Office of Science user facility.
