Molecular charge density waves in a single layer fermion system

November 6, 2020

In a study published in ACS Nano, researchers discovered two-dimensional charge density waves on a silver surface.

Scientific Achievement

Robust two-dimensional charge density waves (CDW) are discovered in organic-inorganic molecular islands of just a single constituent thickness on a Ag(111) surface.  

Significance and Impact

CDW is intensely studied in inorganic materials such as high Tc superconductors; the discovery of CDW in just a single-layer thick molecular island opens a new avenue of research in strongly correlated systems formed by organic molecules. 

Research Details

α-(BEDT-TTF)2-I3 films were studied via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the Center for Nanoscale Materials 9CNM) and Ohio University.

STM images at 80 K and 5 K reveal coexistence of certain CDW patterns commensurate with the underlying molecular lattice.

The CDW can be shifted a molecular lattice site by energy transfer of a single inelastic tunneling electron.

DFT calculations were performed at the CNM.

Work was performed in part at the CNM.
