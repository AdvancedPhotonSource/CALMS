Diamond nanofeather structure lays ground for low-cost fabrication of energy storage devices

April 8, 2019

In a recent study published in Diamond and Related Materials, researchers report that with specific pore size and ease of fabrication, diamond nanofeathers could be a great material choice for supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, and solar cells etc.

Scientific Achievement

A unique diamond nanofeather structure, distinct from conventional ultra- and nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD and NCD) structures, offers ease of fabrication, a high density of nanopores, and a 300-fold increase in capacitance.

Significance and Impact

The electrochemical etching method employed may offer a low-cost alternative to traditional diamond nano–structure fabrication techniques, eliminating masks and templates, and resulting in high performance materials.

Research Details

We fabricated and analyzed samples produced from NCDs grown on boron doped Si wafers, both etched and unetched, and compared a series of DNF samples with varied etch times.  

This work used Raman spectroscopy and high resolution SEM resources at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
