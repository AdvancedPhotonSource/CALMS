High-entropy alloy nanoparticles with high oxidation resistance

January 11, 2021

In a study published in ACS Nano, researchers discovered far-reaching applications of nanoparticles made of multiple elements.

Schematic of in situ gas cell TEM to study oxidation of HEA nanoparticles in real-time.

Scientific Achievement

High-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles (FeCoNiCuPt) show significantly slower oxidation kinetics compared to monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles due to the formation of a disordered oxide.

Significance and Impact

This study contributes understanding toward the design of stable metal catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of using an in situ TEM gas cell for nanodynamics studies. 

Research Details

During oxidation, co-segregation of metals form a disordered oxide layer that can slow oxidation kinetics compared to monometallic and bimetallic systems. Localized ordering is identified in the oxide layer that originate from Fe2O3, CoO, NiO and CuO crystallites.

The JEOL-JEM 2100 electron microscope and Hummingbird in situ gas-cell TEM holder was utilized at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Work was performed in part at CNM.
