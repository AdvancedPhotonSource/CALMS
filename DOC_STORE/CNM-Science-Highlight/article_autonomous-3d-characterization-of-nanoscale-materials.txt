Autonomous 3D characterization of nanoscale materials

February 10, 2020

In a study published in Nature Computational Materials, researchers developed a machine learning technique that combines topology and image processing to visualize 3D micro-structures and characterize features that affect their material properties.

Major steps for machine learning method for autonomous microstructural characterization of 3D polycrystalline samples.

Scientific Achievement

An unsupervised machine learning technique was developed for visualizing and quantifying micro-structures in three-dimensional (3D) samples with data from molecular dynamics simulations, particle tracking data, and experiments.

Significance and Impact

The technique provides a way to quickly identify, track, and quantify complex microstructural features that impact the observed behavior of materials with many technological applications.

Research Details

The technique provides microstructural information regarding e.g. grains and their size distributions in 3D polycrystalline samples, voids and porosity in 3D polymeric samples, and micellar size distribution in 3D complex fluids.

Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) Carbon HPC, Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, National Energy Scientific Computing Center and Argonne’s Laboratory Computing Resource Center were used.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
