Silica nanodepletors: Targeting and clearing Alzheimer’s β-amyloid peptide plaques

March 9, 2020

In a study published in Advanced Functional Materials, researchers designed a nanodevice to prevent peptides from forming dangerous plaques in the brain in order to halt development of Alzheimer’s disease.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Aβ samples in the absence (left) and presence (right) of Aβ nanodepletors. The nanodepletors are the black specks in the right image. The self-assembly of the Aβ peptides is visible in the left photo in the absence of the nanodepletors. 

Scientific Achievement

We developed a mesoporous silica nanostructure that, when covered in ultrasmall antibody fragments, traps β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, thus preventing their self-assembly.

Significance and Impact

This silica nanodepletor prevents aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide aggregates and, when injected into the brain, can reduce the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease in vivo.
