Scientific Achievement

A new electrocatalyst converts carbon dioxide and water into ethanol with very high energy efficiency and high selectivity for the desired final product and at low cost.

Significance and Impact

The process resulting from this catalyst would contribute to the circular carbon economy, which entails the reuse of carbon dioxide.

Research Details

The electrocatalytic selectivity, or ​“Faradaic efficiency,” of the process is over 90%, higher than any other reported process. 

The catalyst demonstrates stable operation over extended operation at low distributions around grain boundaries.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) identified a reversible transformation from atomically dispersed Cu atoms to Cun clusters upon application of electrochemical conditions.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) confirmed the copper catalyst structure.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
