Forming a more perfect union: optimizing organic to inorganic perovskite ratios through microscopy

March 11, 2019

In a recent study published in Science, researchers found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. 

The chemical nature and the electronic properties of Rb aggregates in OSt perovskites. (A and B) Plan-view EBIC profile (A) and the correlated Rb-XRF map (B) of the 5%Rb-I/Br perovskite device. Three regions are marked with focused ion beam (FIB). Area 1 and area 2 are the low- and high-EBIC regions, respectively. Scale bars, 10 μm. (C) Scatterplot between Rb concentration and its effect on EBIC charge collection. The individual data points are produced by taking the average within 10 × 10 square pixel boxes in (B). (D) The Rb XRF map convoluted with the beam generation profile and a Gaussian diffusion broadening of 600 nm. (E) The corresponding EBIC profile of the selected Rb XRF maps. Scale bars, 5 μm. (F) An x-ray diffraction pattern taken at 8 keV with 50 μm spot size in the area within the whole region shown in (A). (G and H) The scanning x-ray Bragg diffraction microscopy map for areas 1 and 2 taken at the RbPbI3 Bragg condition where 2θ = 27.48°. Scale bars, 5 μm. (I) Cross-section EBIC, simultaneously collected SE/BSE, and corresponding EDX. Scale bars, 1 μm.

Scientific Achievement

The degree of alkali metal concentration was found to control beneficial halide homogenization within perovskite solar cells.

Significance and Impact

The nanostructural and nanochemical origins of performance enhancement were directly observed with electron and nanoscale x-ray microscopy - creating potentially novel strategies for energy harvesting.

Research Details

Perovskite thin film solar cells were prepared with varying amounts of lead halide precursors – excess, sufficient, deficient, in order to optimize performance through carrier lifetime

Performance enhancement was understood by a direct observation of halide distribution using nanoscale x-ray fluorescence, structure using scanning x-ray diffraction, and local recombination using x-ray / electron beam induced current 

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source.
