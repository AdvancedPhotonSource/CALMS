Forming a more perfect union: optimizing organic to inorganic perovskite ratios through microscopy

March 11, 2019

In a recent study published in Science, researchers found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. 

The chemical nature and the electronic properties of Rb aggregates in OSt perovskites. (A and B) Plan-view EBIC profile (A) and the correlated Rb-XRF map (B) of the 5%Rb-I/Br perovskite device. Three regions are marked with focused ion beam (FIB). Area 1 and area 2 are the low- and high-EBIC regions, respectively. Scale bars, 10 μm. (C) Scatterplot between Rb concentration and its effect on EBIC charge collection. The individual data points are produced by taking the average within 10 × 10 square pixel boxes in (B). (D) The Rb XRF map convoluted with the beam generation profile and a Gaussian diffusion broadening of 600 nm. (E) The corresponding EBIC profile of the selected Rb XRF maps. Scale bars, 5 μm. (F) An x-ray diffraction pattern taken at 8 keV with 50 μm spot size in the area within the whole region shown in (A). (G and H) The scanning x-ray Bragg diffraction microscopy map for areas 1 and 2 taken at the RbPbI3 Bragg condition where 2θ = 27.48°. Scale bars, 5 μm. (I) Cross-section EBIC, simultaneously collected SE/BSE, and corresponding EDX. Scale bars, 1 μm.

Scientific Achievement

The degree of alkali metal concentration was found to control beneficial halide homogenization within perovskite solar cells.

Significance and Impact

The nanostructural and nanochemical origins of performance enhancement were directly observed with electron and nanoscale x-ray microscopy - creating potentially novel strategies for energy harvesting.

Research Details

Perovskite thin film solar cells were prepared with varying amounts of lead halide precursors – excess, sufficient, deficient, in order to optimize performance through carrier lifetime

Performance enhancement was understood by a direct observation of halide distribution using nanoscale x-ray fluorescence, structure using scanning x-ray diffraction, and local recombination using x-ray / electron beam induced current 

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source.

About the Advanced Photon Source

The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the world’s most productive X-ray light source facilities. The APS provides high-brightness X-ray beams to a diverse community of researchers in materials science, chemistry, condensed matter physics, the life and environmental sciences, and applied research. These X-rays are ideally suited for explorations of materials and biological structures; elemental distribution; chemical, magnetic, electronic states; and a wide range of technologically important engineering systems from batteries to fuel injector sprays, all of which are the foundations of our nation’s economic, technological, and physical well-being. Each year, more than 5,000 researchers use the APS to produce over 2,000 publications detailing impactful discoveries, and solve more vital biological protein structures than users of any other X-ray light source research facility. APS scientists and engineers innovate technology that is at the heart of advancing accelerator and light-source operations. This includes the insertion devices that produce extreme-brightness X-rays prized by researchers, lenses that focus the X-rays down to a few nanometers, instrumentation that maximizes the way the X-rays interact with samples being studied, and software that gathers and manages the massive quantity of data resulting from discovery research at the APS.

This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline. Argonne researchers work closely with researchers from hundreds of companies, universities, and federal, state and municipal agencies to help them solve their specific problems, advance America’s scientific leadership and prepare the nation for a better future. With employees from more than 60 nations, Argonne is managed by UChicago Argonne, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time. For more information, visit https://​ener​gy​.gov/​s​c​ience.
