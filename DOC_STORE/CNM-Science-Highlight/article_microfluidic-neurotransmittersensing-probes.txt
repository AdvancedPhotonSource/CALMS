Microfluidic neurotransmitter-sensing probes

June 9, 2021

In a study published in Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, researchers developed a device that can sense neurotransmitters in the brain.

General design of the brain-implant probe.

Scientific Achievement

A microfluidic device was developed capable of simultaneous sensing of glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vivo, at faster (sub-second vs minutes) times, and higher accuracy (26x higher for GABA and 4x higher for GLU) than existing methods.

Significance and Impact

Allows brain-implant investigation of neurobiological mechanisms and disease symptoms of various brain disorders.

Research Details

Specific enzymes micro-spotted onto electrodes decompose GLU and GABA generating H2O2, which is detected amperometrically.

A microchannel allows injecting calibration fluid or drugs.
