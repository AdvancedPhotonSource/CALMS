Neural networks help push the limits of nanoscale X-ray coherent diffraction imaging

September 14, 2020

In a study published in Applied Physics Letters, researchers develop a fast, dose-efficient, high-resolution method for AI-enabled scanning coherent imaging.

PtychoNN learns to predict the sample amplitude and phase from nano-focused X-ray scanning data.

Scientific Achievement

Development of an AI-enabled scanning coherent imaging method (PtychoNN) was demonstrated to be fast, dose efficient and capable of high resolution.

Significance and Impact

This approach relieves key computational challenges faced by ptychographic X-ray phase retrieval methods, and it is 100x faster with 20% the data.

Research Details

Ptychographic image reconstruction of nano-focused X-ray scattering data was partially replaced with a deep convolutional neural network (PtychoNN).

PtychoNN learned to predict sample amplitude and phase in a single step from the raw coherent imaging data alone.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source.
