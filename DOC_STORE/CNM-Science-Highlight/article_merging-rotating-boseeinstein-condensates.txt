Merging rotating Bose-Einstein condensates

April 9, 2020

In a study published in the Physical Review Letters, researchers simulated the transfer of angular momentum between rotating and stationary samples of a quantum fluid, revealing a corkscrew mechanism responsible for the transfer. 

Merging dynamics of two BECs with one static and the other rotating. Angular momentum (bottom plots in blue) is efficiently transferred due to the spontaneously emergence of a “corkscrew soliton sheet” at the interface. This transfer does not need any conventional fluid convection or vortex diffusion.

Scientific Achievement

A new mechanism of angular momentum transfer via a ​“corkscrew soliton sheet” in Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) quantum fluids is theoretically demonstrated.

Significance and Impact

This finding may impact the study of rotating quantum fluids, from nanoscale ultracold atoms to cosmological-scale neutron-pair superfluids in neutron stars and galactic dark matter halos.

Research Details

Simulated a static BEC merging with a rotating BEC in 3D space

Showed that a soliton-like sheet (a topological quantum structure), resembling a corkscrew, spontaneously emerges at the interface and dominates in highly efficient angular momentum transfer

Used the Center for Nanoscale Materials’s (CNM) Carbon cluster for part of the simulation work

Work was performed in part at CNM.
