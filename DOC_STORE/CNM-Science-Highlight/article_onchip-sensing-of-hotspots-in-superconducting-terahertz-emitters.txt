On-chip sensing of hotspots in superconducting terahertz emitters

June 8, 2020

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers developed a novel sensing technique that opens doors for superconducting devices for quantum information science. 

Upper panel: Scanning electron microscope image of a stand-alone three-terminal superconducting terahertz emitter with five micro-nano-sized sensors located along one side of the top electrode. Lower panel: Three-dimensional structure of the emitter and sensors. The dimensions of the emitter is 300um x 50um x 1um and the dimensions of the sensors is 5um x 5um x 30nm. By measuring the critical current through the micro-sensors at different applied current of the emitter, accurate temperature distributions can be obtained.

Scientific Achievement

A novel technique is developed to characterize, on-chip and in-situ, the non-uniform temperature distributions on high-Tc superconductor BSCCO for achieving coherent THz photon emission.

Significance and Impact

This intrinsic Josephson junction sensor array provides a new element in next-generation terahertz circuits and opens a new route towards high-quality nonlinear superconducting devices for quantum information science.

Research Details

A micro-nanosized intrinsic Josephson-junction sensor array was fabricated on BSCCO.

Temperature distribution was determined by measuring the critical current of each junction stack.

Cleanroom and low-temperature facilities at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) were used for this work. 

Work was performed in part at CNM.
