Scientific Achievement

Halide perovskites exhibit unprecedented optoelectronic properties, but degrade rapidly under operating conditions. Applying a unique approach to nanoscale characterization, this study determined the root causes behind this degradation for a lead halide perovskite. 

Significance and Impact

The absorption signature was detected down to the atomic level. The nanoscale characterization approach shows great potential for unraveling the optoelectronic mechanisms in perovskites under illumination, electric fields, different temperatures, or a combination thereof. This results can aid in creating more efficient, cheaper, and longer-lasting solar materials.

Research Details

The nanoscale approach to material characterization employed single-molecule absorption scanning tunneling microscopy (SMA-STM), synchrotron X-ray STM (SX-STM), and time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering.
