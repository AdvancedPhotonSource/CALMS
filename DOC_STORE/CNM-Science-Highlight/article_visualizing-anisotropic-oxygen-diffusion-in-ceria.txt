Visualizing anisotropic oxygen diffusion in ceria

October 15, 2020

In a study published in Physical Review Letters, researchers investigate materials used for fuel cell catalysis.

Serial aberration-corrected high-resolution TEM images of the (001), (110) and (111) CeO2 surfaces under reduction. A reactive oxygen atom and its real-time diffusion were directly visualized using chromatic aberration-corrected TEM.

Scientific Achievement

Anisotropic oxygen atom diffusion was visualized in ceria under activated conditions; the diffusion was dependent upon crystal orientation, demonstrating a preferential [001] diffusion pathway.

Significance and Impact

Oxygen reactivity plays a key role in the performance of ceria-based catalysts of interest for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and solid-oxide fuel cells for energy storage.

Research Details

The interplay between Ce and O atoms originates from Coulombic interactions as revealed by the out-of-plane buckling of cerium atoms associated with oxygen transport. 

Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) electron microscopy capabilities included the Argonne Chromatic Aberration-corrected TEM (ACAT) and Talos TEM. 

Work was performed in part at CNM.
