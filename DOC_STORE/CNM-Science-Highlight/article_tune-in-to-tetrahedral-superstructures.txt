Tune in to tetrahedral superstructures

October 15, 2018

In a recent study published in Nature, researchers from Argonne’s CNM working with Brown University have packed non-spherical nanocrystals into complex superstructures – including some with chirality.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of tetrahedral quantum dots (TTQD): (a) the building blocks of the complex structures; (b) High-resolution (HR)-TEM image (top) of an individual TTQD; (c) High-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF)-TEM images of TTQDs.

Scientific Achievement

Using self-assembly methods we produced and, for the first time, observed single-component tetrahedral building blocks in three distinct complex superstructures, including a one-dimensional chiral tetrahelix.

Significance and Impact

The observations expand the collection of super-structures that can use tetrahedral building blocks; the findings bring the spontaneous formation of nanocrystal assemblies to a higher level of complexity, including chirality in some cases.

Research Details

Truncated tetrahedral quantum dots in solution self-assembled into one, two, and three dimensions with one common structural feature:  preferred facet-to-facet alignment.

Scanning TEM (STEM) and STEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping were performed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
