Explaining the Optical Properties of CdSe Nanoplatelets

February 22, 2023

In the Journal of Physical Chemistry C, scientists report that CdSe nanoparticles show better optical features than even the best preparations of colloidal quantum dots of the same composition.

(a) Photoluminescence of CdSe nanoplatelets with thickness  of 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 monolayers (ML) at temperatures of 295 K (solid lines) and 2.7 K (dashed lines). (b) Full width at half-maximum of the exciton line of photoluminescence at the lowest reported temperature in literature for 4.5 ML samples. (c) Time-resolved photoluminescence of the same samples as (a). (d) Literature measurements of the exciton coherent center-of-mass area of CdSe nanoplatelets. 

Scientific Achievement

Fast photoluminescence lifetimes of CdSe nanoplatelets previously suggested suppressed exciton scattering at low temperature, but multiple measurements of exciton motion confirm that excitons remain localized.

Significance and Impact

Because CdSe nanoplatelets show narrower absorption

and emission features than colloidal quantum dots, they have attracted interest in optical applications such as light-emitting diodes and lasers. Low temperature photo-physics of the samples informs underlying mechanisms of light emission and optical gain.

Research Details

Measurements of static absorption, transient absorption bleaching, and the optical Stark effect were performed between room temperature and 3 K on a series of nanoplatelet samples.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials, a DOE Office of Science user facility.
