Nanomaterial for wireless brain stimulation with X-rays

March 8, 2021

In a study published in ACS Nano, researchers demonstrated that radioluminescent nanoparticles implanted in the brain and exposed to X-rays might be used for direct brain stimulation to treat neurological conditions.

Artist rendering of wireless optogenetic control of cortical neurons enabled by radioluminescent nanoparticles (NPs). Gd₂(WO₄)₃:Eu (GdWEu) NPs act as mediators that absorb X-ray energy and then emit optical luminescence with λmax at 610 nm, in accord with a red-shifted variant channel-rhodopsin (ReaChR) window of 590-630 nm.

Scientific Achievement

We demonstrated in vivo that an optogenetic technique using radioluminescent Gd2(WO4)3:Eu (GdWEu) nanoparticles exposed to X-rays can be used for the noninvasive transcranial stimulation of brain neurons.

Significance and Impact

This noninvasive method could use X-ray machines such as those in the dentist’s office for direct brain stimulation to treat neurological conditions.

Research Details

GdWEu nanoparticles were synthesized and analyzed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) using transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared analysis and the joint CNM/Advanced Photon Source (APS) hard X-ray nanoprobe beamline.

X-ray fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy done at APS.

In vivo tests done on brains pretreated with virus encoding ReaChR and radioluminescent NPs at University of Maryland.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
