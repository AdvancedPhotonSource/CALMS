Superlubricity in rolling/sliding contacts

November 11, 2019

In a study published in Applied Physics Letters, researchers showed that superlubricity was achieved in rolling/sliding contact through the formation of a carbon-rich tribolayer at the tribological interface.

Diamondlike carbon-diamondlike carbon (DLC-DLC) test setup and traction coefficient results. (a) Traction (COF) for DLC-DLC tests without (baseline) and with the MoS2+nanodiamond (MoSND) test with run-in (0–30 min) and steady state (30–180 min) periods. (b) Micropitting Rig (MPR) Setup in the dry nitrogen environment at a load of 75 N, a speed of 0.5 m/s and a slide-to-roll ratio (SRR) of 2%. (c) Traction (COF) for a period of 120 min–180 min showing end traction superlubric values achieved using MoSND solid lubricant.

Scientific Achievement

Superlubricity (near zero friction) was achieved in rolling/sliding contact through the formation of a carbon-rich tribolayer at the tribological interface. This reduced the overall friction at least 20-fold, with no surface damage, as compared to steel-steel contacts lubricated with oil.

Significance and Impact

Replacing conventional oil-based lubricants with next-generation solid lubricants would have significant efficiency implications in a variety of industrial applications involving roller bearings and gears.

Research Details

Developed a system of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 combined with nanodiamonds as a solid lubricant and demonstrated superlubricity in a micropitting rig (MPR) to test and qualify nanoscale lubricants for bearings and gear systems.

Center for Nanoscale Materials capabilities included transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
