Scientific Achievement

A large-scale framework with built-in vertical nanohole arrays is demonstrated using a unique two-step fabrication method. 

Significance and Impact

This approach creates large-scale surface plasmon nanohole arrays. The strong surface plasmon modes in the nanostructures can serve as reusable optical sensors for trace-amount detection and tracking of biomolecules.

Research Details

Fabrication was performed at Purdue University. The nanoholes are 6 nm on average, with a packing distance of 8 nm and high epitaxial quality. 

Optical spectroscopy was performed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), and numerical simulations were performed using CNM’s Carbon cluster. 

Work was performed in part at CNM.
