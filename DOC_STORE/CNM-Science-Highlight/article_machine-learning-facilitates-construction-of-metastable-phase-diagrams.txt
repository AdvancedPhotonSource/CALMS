July 26, 2022

In a paper appearing in Nature Communications, researchers report a machine learning-based approach for producing phase diagrams, which are applicable to metastable materials that are far from equilibrium.

Scientific Achievement

A machine learning-based approach has been developed for producing metastable phase diagrams, which are applicable to materials that are far from equilibrium. This automated framework combines machine learning and high-performance computing with first-principles physics and atomistic simulations.

Significance and Impact

This approach is able to predict, identify, and map the free energy of metastable materials. The results can be used for designing experiments and accelerating the discovery of metastable materials, which often display exotic properties with practical applications.

Research Details

A metastable phase diagram was constructed for carbon to map hundreds of metastable states ranging from near equilibrium to far from equilibrium (400 meV/atom).
