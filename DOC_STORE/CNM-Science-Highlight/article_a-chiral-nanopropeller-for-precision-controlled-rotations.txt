A chiral nano-propeller for precision controlled rotations

September 9, 2019

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers developed and characterized a multi-component molecular propeller that enables unidirectional rotations on a material surface when energized.

Chirality and electronic structure. STM image of two molecular propellers on Au(111) surface showing left-handed (M) and right-handed (P) chirality [Imaging parameters: Vt = −1.2 V, It = 70 pA].

Scientific Achievement

A molecular propeller was created that, upon excitation, can rotate clockwise or anticlockwise with atomic level precision on a surface depending on its chirality.

Significance and Impact

Controlling the rotational direction of molecular machines provides atomic level understanding of the mechanism involved, and impacts their development for potential applications ranging from catalysis to quantum computation.

Research Details

Artificially synthesized molecular propellers were deposited on a Au(111) crystal surface.

Controlled rotation was performed by supplying electrical energy or by using inelastic tunneling electrons from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip at Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Work was performed in part at CNM.
