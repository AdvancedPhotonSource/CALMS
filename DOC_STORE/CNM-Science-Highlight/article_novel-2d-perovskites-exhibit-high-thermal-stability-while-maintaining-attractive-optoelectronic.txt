Novel 2D perovskites exhibit high thermal stability while maintaining attractive optoelectronic properties

August 21, 2023

In a Journal of the American Chemical Society paper, scientists report that cyclic spacers offer more desirable properties compared to linear ones when designing 2D lead iodide perovskites with thermally-demanding optoelectronic applications.

Phase transition and lack thereof with increased temperature in structures of 2D perovskites possessing linear (left side)  and cyclic (right side) organic spacers within a lead iodide sublattice.

Scientific Achievement

Six 2D lead iodide perovskites of different compositions were studied at 250–420 K to elucidate the effect of linear and cyclic spacers in these materials. The perovskites’ thermal behavior was found to be dictated by the identity and shape of the organic spacers.

Significance and Impact

The lead iodide perovskites with cyclic spacers exposed to increased temperatures exhibit no phase transitions while maintaining attractive optical properties, making them prime candidates as next-generation materials in devices such as solar cells and lasers.

Research Details

Variable temperature X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence were performed for perovskites with spacers of butylammonium, pentylammonium, hexylammonium, cyclobutylammonium, cyclopentyl-ammonium, and cyclohexylammonium.
