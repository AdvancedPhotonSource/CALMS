Ligands influence nanoparticle superstructure properties

June 10, 2019

Above their threshold ligand coverage density, nanoparticle superlattices are shown to preserve their crystalline order even under high applied pressures and have reversible pressure behavior. 

A coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation image depicts a superlattice of nanoparticles (yellow) stabilized by ligands (blue) on a background image of the  superlattice taken by optical microscopy. 

Scientific Achievement

Useful structural and mechanical properties of nanoparticle superlattices (NPSLs) are shown to originate from the interplay of ligand coverage, mobility and molecular-scale dynamics in the spaces between neighboring nanoparticles. Highly ordered arrays of ligand-stabilized colloidal nanoparticles, or NPSLs, have exceptional thermal, mechanical, electronic and optical properties. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations were combined with in situ SAXS experiments at the Advanced Photon Source in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) to explore dynamic processes at the molecular level. The structural response of NPSLs to applied pressure, their mechanical properties, as well as NP–NP spacing are strongly correlated with the surface mobility of ligands, their spatial distribution between neighboring NPs, and the extent of ligand-interdigitation. A certain critical density of ligand coverage on the constituent NPs is required to form stable NPSLs. Above the critical coverage, NPSLs preserve their crystalline order even up to high applied pressures (∼40 GPa); more importantly, the pressure-induced changes in NP–NP spacing are completely recovered upon release. The PbS NPs (7 nm) were synthesized at CNM by colloidal synthesis. The predictions of CGMD simulations are in good accordance with electron microscopy and SAXS characterization of NPSLs. The fundamental knowledge of ligand dynamics and its connection to the assembly process is not only crucial for gaining precise control over the physical properties of NPSLs, but is also essential to design pathways to synthesize these hybrid crystals with desired crystallinity.

Significance and Impact

Knowledge of the impact of ligand dynamics on behavior of NPSLs can help scientists to finely tune their electronic, optical, thermo-mechanical and magnetic properties. Their unique sets of properties make NPSLs promising for numerous optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and sensing applications.

Research Details

Faceted NPSL analogues of atomic crystals were synthesized in a toluene solution, characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in situ SAXS X-ray techniques, and were modeled by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.

Synthesis and microscopy of the nanoparticle superlattice and part of the computational modeling were performed at CNM. SAXS measurements were performed at APS.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and the Advanced Photon Source.
