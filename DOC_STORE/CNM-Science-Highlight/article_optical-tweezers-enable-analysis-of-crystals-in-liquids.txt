Optical ​“tweezers” enable analysis of crystals in liquids

May 13, 2019

In a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers demonstrate that dynamic holographic optical tweezers are capable of manipulating single micrometer-scale anisotropic particles in a microfluidic environment.

Scientific Achievement

This noncontact sample manipulation technique of optical trapping allows for manipulating single particles in solution, without inducing undesired changes in structure, to obtain 3D maps of shape and strain.

Significance and Impact

Obtaining a fundamental understanding of crystal growth and chemical reactions in solution is of broad interest for materials discovery, structural biology, and catalysis.

Research Details

Microfluidic cell fabrication and electrodynamics simulations on the HPC Carbon cluster were performed at CNM.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline 34-ID-C at APS. This method, based on dynamic holographic optical trapping in a standing-wave geometry, allows sufficient angular stability to perform Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI).

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and the Advanced Photon Source.
