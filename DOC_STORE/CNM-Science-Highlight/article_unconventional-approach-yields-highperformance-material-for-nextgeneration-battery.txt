Unconventional approach yields high-performance material for next-generation battery

August 2, 2022

In a paper published in Nature Communications, researchers synthesized a novel rock-salt electrode material by the unconventional approach of crystallization of amorphous nano-channeled Nb2O5 during initial cell cycling.

Transmission electron microscopy verified the transformation of the electrode material from a disordered arrangement of atoms (left) to an ordered, crystalline structure (right). 

Scientific Achievement

A novel rock-salt electrode material has been produced by the unconventional approach of crystallization of amorphous nano-channeled Nb2O5 during initial cell cycling. The rock-salt electrode reversibly cycles three Li ions per Nb2O5,Â  yielding very high capacity with superb capacity stability over 400 cycles. The unique crystalline structure also permits fast charging.

Significance and Impact

The electrode has application for electric vehicles while the new approach is applicable to creating other new metal oxide electrodes.

Research Details

Transmission electron microscopy at CNM verified the structural transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction at APS confirmed the structural change.

Work was performed, in part, at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) and Advanced Photon Source (APS).
