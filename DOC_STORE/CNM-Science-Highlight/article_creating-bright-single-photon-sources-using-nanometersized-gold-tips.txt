Creating bright single photon sources using nanometer-sized gold tips

November 6, 2020

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers created single photon sources for quantum communication.

Schematic of strains induced by gold-nanostars on WSe₂ monolayers.

Scientific Achievement

Nanometer-sized gold tips were used to create bright single photon emitters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with ultrahigh spatial precisions.

Significance and Impact

This work will enable the creation of bright, large scale single photon sources in TMDs that could be used for quantum communication applications.

Research Details

We fabricated TMD monolayers and induced local strain fields with high spatial previsions by using nanometer-sized gold tips.

We studied the single photon emission qualities of the emitters using low-temperature single particle spectroscopy.

The study employed the photon-correlation microscope at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Work was performed in part at CNM.
