Revealing the intrinsic nature of quantum transitions in non-classical photon sources

September 10, 2018

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers present an approach for disentangling the effects of dipole degeneracy and electric field renormalization on emission anisotropy.

(a) TEM image of CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. (b) Simulated excitation pattern of an emitter dipole shows uniform absorption.

Scientific Achievement

We show how polarized single photon emission from semiconductor nanoplatelets can be achieved despite their 2D isotropic emission dipoles.

Significance and Impact

This work will further enable quantum optics and quantum network opportunities utilizing nanoscale single photon emitters by manipulating their emission polarization and directionality.

Research Details

Absorption and emission dipoles of core/shell CdSe/CdS semiconductor nanoplatelets were studied using single particle spectroscopy at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

The study employed the quantum entanglement microscope and dry etching capabilities at the CNM.
