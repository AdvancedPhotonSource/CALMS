Role of residual strain revealed in optical response and stability of perovskite single crystals

May 13, 2019

In a recent study published in Chemistry of Materials, researchers found nanodiffracton results suggest a necessary path to enhance stability of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices from light-emitting diodes to high-energy detectors.

(a) Schematic of the nano-diffraction measurement of an out-of-plane strain gradient induced in a perovskite thin film single crystal by the CTE mismatch at the quartz and Pt substrate interfaces beneath it. The scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy quantifies the out-of-plane strain component only, ε220. (b) Experimental diffraction patterns of (i) low local strain and (ii) high local strain regions in crystal. Simulated diffraction patterns of (iii) low-strain and (iv) high-strain regions in crystal. The shift of the bright vertical fringe on the circular aperture is caused by strain. (c) Plan view XRF map of Cs (green) and Pt (purple) counts, indicating the crystal’s position across the quartz/Pt edge. (d) Experimental out-of-plane strain map in a CsPbBr3 crystal characterized by SXDM on the quartz/Pt substrate.

Scientific Achievement

Residual strain was found to locally degrade stability and shift optical photoluminescence in halide perovskites.

Significance and Impact

The nanostructural origins of optical performance and photo-stability were directly observed using nanoscale x-ray microscopy - informing new routes for strain engineering of emergent optoelectronic materials.

Research Details

Perovskite CsPbBr3 thin film single crystals were prepared by a fast crystallization process of spin-casting and annealing

Structural and chemical imaging were performed by nanoscale synchrotron x-ray fluorescence and scanning diffraction microscopy using the joint CNM/APS nanoprobe, and correlated with ex-situ photoluminescence mapping at UCSD

The x-ray nanobeam also was used as a tunable source of photochemical degradation to directly assess local structural stability

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source.

About the Advanced Photon Source

The U. S. Department of Energy Office of Science’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the world’s most productive X-ray light source facilities. The APS provides high-brightness X-ray beams to a diverse community of researchers in materials science, chemistry, condensed matter physics, the life and environmental sciences, and applied research. These X-rays are ideally suited for explorations of materials and biological structures; elemental distribution; chemical, magnetic, electronic states; and a wide range of technologically important engineering systems from batteries to fuel injector sprays, all of which are the foundations of our nation’s economic, technological, and physical well-being. Each year, more than 5,000 researchers use the APS to produce over 2,000 publications detailing impactful discoveries, and solve more vital biological protein structures than users of any other X-ray light source research facility. APS scientists and engineers innovate technology that is at the heart of advancing accelerator and light-source operations. This includes the insertion devices that produce extreme-brightness X-rays prized by researchers, lenses that focus the X-rays down to a few nanometers, instrumentation that maximizes the way the X-rays interact with samples being studied, and software that gathers and manages the massive quantity of data resulting from discovery research at the APS.

This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.

Argonne National Laboratory seeks solutions to pressing national problems in science and technology. The nation’s first national laboratory, Argonne conducts leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline.
