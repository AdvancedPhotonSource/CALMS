Molecular additive improves stretchable semiconductors for skin-like electronics

July 25, 2022

In a paper published in Advanced Materials, researchers report on a molecular additive that improves the performance of stretchable electronics made with a well-known conjugated polymer.

Schematic of chain packing morphologies before and after DOP treatment of DPP-TVT, a high-mobility conjugated polymer with aromatic planar backbone and long-branched alkyl side chains. The loosened chain packing structure improves the stretchability of the conjugated polymer.

Scientific Achievement

Under strain, stretchable electronics made with a well-known conjugated polymer containing a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), exhibited anisotropic charge-carrier mobilities and stable current output. The additive acted as a molecular spacer to increase the amorphous fraction of chain networks and disrupt crystalline laminar layers.

Significance and Impact

Possible applications for conjugated polymers capable of both electrical functions and deformation under strain include skin-like electronics, soft robotics, and flexible devices for energy harvesting and storage.

Research Details

Testing of DOP-treated polymer electronics showed 2.5-fold higher charge-carrier mobility compared to non-stretched material and stable current when stretched to 100% strain.

Work was performed, in part, at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).
