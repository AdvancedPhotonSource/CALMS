Scientific Achievement

A Crystal Edge Graph Attention Neural Network (CEGANN) based on graph attention-based workflow was developed to classify materials across multiple scales (from atomic to mesoscale) and diverse classes (metals, oxides, non-metals, zeolites, semi-ordered mesophases, and more).

Significance and Impact

This neural network will help meet the urgent need for automated tools to analyze large amounts of structural data in characterizing materials with unique properties.

Research Details

Validated the efficacy of CEGANN in the case of nucleation and growth of a zeolite, a complex porous crystal, in molecular dynamics simulations of synthesis with thermal variations or noise.
