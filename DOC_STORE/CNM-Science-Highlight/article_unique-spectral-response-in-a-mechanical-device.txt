Unique spectral response in a mechanical device

December 17, 2018

Using a single actuation signal, a frequency comb is generated in a micromechanical resonator from two vibrational modes, flexural and torsional, whose interactions are responsible for the unique response.

Scientific Achievement

Using a single actuation signal, we generate a novel response—a frequency comb—in a micromechanical resonator and demonstrate the mechanism behind the behavior. Mode coupling can be nonresonant, where the frequencies of the different vibrational modes do not match and result in inefficiency or instability, or resonant, where the frequencies of the different modes satisfy proportional relationships and produce efficient energy transfer or improve stability. Both nonresonant and resonant typically require multiple external signals to create the multiple modes. In this work, using a micromechanical device, we generate both a flexural mode and a torsional mode with a single signal. The two modes have proportional frequencies and couple to generate a ​“frequency comb.” Further investigation traces the source of the novel behavior to a branching of the vibrational frequency into two stable paths—a bifurcation. A generic model describes the internal resonance using experimental data from the device. 

Significance and Impact

This completely mechanical model, which can be easily controlled, may be applied to certain biological systems and possibly as a way to emulate neuron interactions.

Research Details

Standard experimental measurements were used to determine the model parameters from the two vibrational modes, flexural and torsional, whose interactions are responsible for the unique frequency comb response. Capabilities from the Center for Nanoscale Materials include electrical equipment to measure device properties.
