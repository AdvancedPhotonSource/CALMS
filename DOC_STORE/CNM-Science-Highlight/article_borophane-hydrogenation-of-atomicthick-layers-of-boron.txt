Borophane: hydrogenation of atomic-thick layers of boron

April 19, 2021

In a study published in Science, researchers demonstrate that the 2D material borophane is much more stable than borophene.

Scientific Achievement

Hydrogenation of borophene resulted in synthesis of stable ​“borophane” polymorphs, which possess modified local work functions and improved chemical passivation characteristics in ambient conditions.

Significance and Impact

These findings showed borophane to be much more stable than borophene and, therefore, attractive for nanoelectronic and quantum information science applications. In addition, the analysis technique developed to unravel the complex structure of borophane is applicable to other complex nanostructures.
