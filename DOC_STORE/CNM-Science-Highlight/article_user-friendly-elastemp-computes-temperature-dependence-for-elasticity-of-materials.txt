User friendly Elastemp computes temperature dependence for elasticity of materials

July 13, 2023

In a Computational Materials Science paper, scientists describe an automated workflow, Elastemp, to predict the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficients and elastic constants for materials.

Workflow to compute elasticity of material. Three major modules involve computation of elastic constants (𝐶11,𝐶12,𝐶44) at 0 K, then thermal expansion coefficients and elastic constants at temperatures up to 1000 K.

Scientific Achievement

A key property to know in developing new materials is their stiffness or elasticity at different temperatures. An automated workflow, Elastemp, was created to calculate the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficients and elastic constants for materials.

Significance and Impact

Elasticity is one the properties often chosen in evaluating the suitability of materials for various applications such as tribology, energy storage, flexible electronics, and superhard materials.

Research Details

Experimental data agreed well with representative calculations using Elastemp for materials with different crystal symmetries (e.g., cubic aluminum, cubic diamond, cubic titanium nitride, and hexagonal 𝛼-titanium) as a function of temperature.
