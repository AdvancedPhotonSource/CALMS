Coherent gate operations in hybrid magnonics

June 9, 2021

In a study published in Physical Review Letters, scientists demonstrated a new way to tune hybrid magnonic dynamics.

The coherent information exchange (black pulse train) between magnons (shaded red area on the left) and microwave photons (shaded blue area on the right) is controlled by the DC pulse trains (square wave at the bottom).

Scientific Achievement

Coherent gate operation on the magnon-microwave photon interaction is achieved for the first time.

Significance and Impact

This work demonstrates a novel approach for directly tuning hybrid magnonic dynamics by DC gating, paving the road for practical coherent information processing using magnons in both classical and quantum regimes.

Research Details

A successful novel gating scheme is shown using a new device design with a fast-responding antenna, allowing the rapid tuning of the magnon-microwave photon interactions.

The detuning between magnons — quasiparticles representing collective spin excitations — and cavity photons is controlled by DC detuning pulse sequences, enabling fast controls over their interactions.

The Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) magneto-electro-optical spectrometer was used.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
