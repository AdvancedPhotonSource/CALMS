Hot electron dynamics

August 10, 2020

In a study published in Nature Materials, researchers advance the understanding of hot-hole dynamics in metal–semiconductor heterostructures.

Design of transient absorption (TA) pump–probe studies using 530 nm excitation to create hot electron–hole pairs on gold nanoparticles and initiate hot-hole injection into p-type GaN while probing (left) the dynamics of hot holes via IR TA or (right) probing the hot-electron dynamics across the visible regime with a broadband white-light probe.

Scientific Achievement 

Ultrafast (t < 200 fs) hot-hole injection from gold nanoparticles into the valence band of p-type GaN alters the thermalization dynamics of hot electrons, reducing peak electronic temperature and electron–phonon coupling time of the gold nanoparticles. 

Significance and Impact

Understanding of hot-carrier dynamics in photo-excited metal nanostructures is needed to unlock their potential for photodetection and photocatalysis. These results advance our understanding of hot-hole dynamics in metal–semiconductor heterostructures.

Research Details

Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) ultrafast transient absorption capabilities were utilized. First-principles calculations reveal hot-hole injection modifies the relaxation dynamics by modulating the electronic structure of the metal.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
