Being exceptional in higher dimensions

December 9, 2019

In a study published in Physical Review Letters, researchers experimentally observed a continuous three-dimensional surface of exceptional points by constructing a four-dimensional synthetic space using magnon polaritons.

Scientific Achievement

An exceptional surface — a continuous three-dimensional surface of exceptional points — is experimentally observed for the first time by constructing a four-dimensional synthetic space using magnon polaritons.

Significance and Impact

This work provides a pathway to engineer new quantum mechanical systems and new opportunities for magnon-based quantum information processing such as robust mode conversion and high-sensitivity sensing.

Research Details

The magnon-photon coupling was characterized at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) by measuring reflection spectra in the microwave frequency range with a polariton system consisting of a specially designed microwave cavity and a magnon cavity.

Work was performed in part at the CNM.
