Nanoscale X-ray imaging with physics-aware deep learning

May 15, 2021

In a study published in Applied Physics Reviews, researchers developed a model to predict material properties from X-ray scattering data.

Physics-aware framework for phase retrieval in 3D coherent diffraction imaging. The main component is a neural network model (3D-CDI-NN) that is trained offline using 3D data derived from atomistic simulations. Once trained, the 3D-CDI-NN model can perform real-time prediction of crystal shape and local strain from experimentally measured diffraction patterns. The prediction can then be refined by a gradient-based optimization procedure.

Scientific Achievement

A model that integrates machine learning and physics-based optimization was developed to predict 3D nanoscale structures and strain solely from input X-ray coherent scattering data.

Significance and Impact

This deep learning model is potentially applicable to similar phase retrieval problems in astronomy and nanoscale imaging with transmission electron microscopy, super-resolution optical imaging and electron and X-ray coherent diffraction.

Research Details

Calculations performed with the computing cluster Carbon at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) and the Joint Laboratory for System Evaluation; beamline 34-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) was used to generate experimental diffraction patterns.

The model can convert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional methods.

Work was performed in part at the CNM and APS.
