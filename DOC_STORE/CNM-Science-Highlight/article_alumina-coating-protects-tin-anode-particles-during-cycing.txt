Alumina coating protects tin anode particles during cycing

March 20, 2023

In a Nanotechnology paper, scientists applied operando focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy to determine the morphological changes in micro-sized alumina-coated tin particles during cycling.

Scientific Achievement

Anodes of tin and other Group IV elements have much higher theoretical capacity than commercial graphite anodes but suffer from rapid capacity fade. In an operando study, the morphology of tin particles coated with alumina maintained their integrity while being cycled, compared with uncoated particles.

Significance and Impact

With optimization of the coating condition and electrode morphology, most of the surface area of next-generation anodes with alumina-coated Sn particles can remain protected during cycling.

Research Details

Operando scanning electron microscopy was employed to study the microstructural evolution during cycling of single Sn particles coated with alumina by atomic layer deposition to different thicknesses.
