Quantum sensing for dark matter detection

January 16, 2023

In a paper appearing in AVS Quantum Science, researchers discuss how recent developments in defect-based quantum sensing pave the way for directional detection of dark matter.

Overview of proposed dark matter detection procedure. (a) The preferred direction of incoming WIMP particles on the earth allows for directional discrimination. (b) WIMPs interact with the detector, leaving crystal damage tracks. (c) Triggered segments are removed from the detector. (d) The structure of crystal damage is mapped using superresolution optical methods or X-ray microscopy.

Scientific Achievement

This paper outlines the vision for a solid-state directional detector of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that integrates real-time event registration, three-dimensional directional information and high-density target material.

Significance and Impact

Directional detectors improve sensitivity to WIMP dark matter and overcome the challenge of irreducible neutrino background. A future WIMP detector will leverage or motivate advances in multiple disciplines toward precision dark matter and neutrino physics.

Research Details

The detector operates in hybrid mode: nuclear recoil event registration is performed in real-time using charge, phonon or photon collection.

The solid-state detector using quantum defects in diamond would provide timing information and complete three-dimensional information via head/tail asymmetric signals.
