Ghost imaging via second harmonic generation within materials

July 13, 2020

In a study published in Applied Physics Letters, researchers developed a new approach to ghost imaging with significant advantages for imaging in scattering environments. 

The schematic for demonstrating ghost imaging sensitive only to second harmonic generation in the sample to be imaged.

Scientific Achievement

A new approach to a remote imaging technique called ghost imaging (GI) is achieved using ultrafast optical pulses to produce second harmonic generation (SHG) within materials.

Significance and Impact

Conventional SHG microscopy enables imaging of defects and interfaces where SHG efficiency is relatively high. GI-SHG adds significant advantages in imaging in scattering environments (e.g., biomaterials, turbulent systems) at lower optical intensities, while using a remote sensing approach. 

Research Details

Nanophotonics and ultrafast laser capabilities at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) were used, as well as computational efforts, termed compressive sensing, that enhanced image recovery rates. 

Work was performed at CNM.
