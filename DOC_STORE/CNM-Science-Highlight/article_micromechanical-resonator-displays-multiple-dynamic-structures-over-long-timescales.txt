Micromechanical resonator displays multiple dynamic structures over long timescales

March 31, 2023

In a report published in Nature Communications, researchers describe a micromechanical resonator for which the response exhibits several complex long-term robust dynamic structures, even though the resonator is driven by a single harmonic drive.

Scientific Achievement

A micromechanical resonator (3 μm×10 μm×500 μm) was built. It consists of a mechanically tethered single-crystal silicon beam. The resonator response exhibits three distinct timescales that span five orders of magnitude larger than the forcing period.

Significance and Impact

This approach has applications in nonlinear robust dynamics related to secure communications, gait control of legged robots, lasers, cardiac response, and brain monitoring.

Research Details

A theoretical representation of the micromechanical resonator response accurately predicts the nonlinear dynamics. It allows one to suggest the magnitude and timing of pulses needed to control the selection of robust dynamic structures.
