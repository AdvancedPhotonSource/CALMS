Ultrafast hot electrons in colloidal quantum wells

May 11, 2022

In a paper published in Nanoscale, researchers report characterizing hot electrons (above the bandgap) by ultrafast optical spectroscopy of optically excited colloidal quantum wells. 

Transient absorption spectra of 4.5 ML CdSe CQWs taken to 1ps with excitation equal to (top panel), and above (bottom panel), the bandgap energy. Evidence for transient absorption due to hot electrons is present only for the above gap excitation. The thinner the CQW, the hotter the electrons that can be produced. 

Scientific Achievement

Ultrafast optical spectroscopy was used to characterize the temporal response and energies of hot electrons (above the bandgap) in optically excited colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) as a function of monolayer (ML) thickness.

Significance and Impact

Hot electrons enable the extraction of greater energy and increased energy conversion efficiency of optoelectronic devices. The challenge is that hot electrons are typically short lived and have varied energies in different materials and structures. This work establishes the evolution of energy vs time after photoexcitation of hot electrons in novel nanoscale CQWs of varying thicknesses, and also shows how to produce them in a controlled manner.
