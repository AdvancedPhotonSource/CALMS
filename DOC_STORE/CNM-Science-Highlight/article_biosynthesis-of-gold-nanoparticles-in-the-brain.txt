Biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles in the brain

November 11, 2019

In a study published in Nanoscale, researchers demonstrated that the pathological biochemical process leading to brain hypoxia, and then to stroke, can be redirected, thereby restoring the redox status of the brain.

(b) Evolution of the UV-vis spectra of NADH upon addition of AuCl3. The molar ratios of AuCl3 to NADH were 1 : 4, 1 : 2 and 3 : 2 upon first, second and third introductions of AuCl3 solution into 100 μM NADH solution, respectively. After addition of 25, 50 and 75 μM AuCl3 aliquots, the reaction was allowed for 40, 20 and 20 min, and monitored by recording of 11 UV-vis spectra. The inset in (b) shows the cuvette with the synthesized Au NPs.

Scientific Achievement

The pathological biochemical process leading to brain hypoxia, and then to stroke, was redirected to the in situ synthesis of biocompatible Au nanoparticles (NPs) near the hypoxia site, restoring the brain tissue redox status.

Significance and Impact

The proposed approach can be implemented not only in the brain but also in transplant tissues and other organs vulnerable to oxygen deficiency (e.g., heart, liver, kidney). We note the 2019 Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine was awarded for discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.

Research Details

Synthesis of Au NP control samples and UV-visible spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy of extracted gold (Au) NPs from tissue samples were performed at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

X-ray scattering measurements were performed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
