New Automated Framework for Image Simulation

June 22, 2022

In a report published in Small, researchers introduce ​“ingrained”, an automated framework for the fusion of atomic-resolution materials imaging simulations into the experimental images to which they correspond.

Series of panels providing an overview of the “ingrained” framework applied to an experimental interface image.

Scientific Achievement

An open-source automated framework (“ingrained”) has been developed for image registration that can fuse simulations of atomic resolution images of materials into the experimental images to which they correspond.

Significance and Impact

Scientists will be able to fully leverage the power of image simulation to corroborate and explain patterns and structures in atomic resolution microscopy.

Research Details

•The researchers demonstrated the ingrained capability with images of grain boundaries in CdTe, a pristine Cu2O surface, and the surface of a 2D material.

•Calculations were primarily performed with the resources of the Laboratory Computing Resource Center at Argonne and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.
