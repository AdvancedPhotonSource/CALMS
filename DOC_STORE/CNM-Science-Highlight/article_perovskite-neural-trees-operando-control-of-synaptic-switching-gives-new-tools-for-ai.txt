Perovskite neural trees: operando control of synaptic switching gives new tools for AI

July 13, 2020

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers demonstrated the potential of perovskite nickelate films to form neuromorphic hardware for decision making. 

The electric field effect on the energy barriers for surface proton doping into the nickelate lattice (left) was experimentally realized in an operando device (right).

Scientific Achievement

Tree-like synaptic conductance states were demonstrated as controllable by high speed electric pulses in strongly correlated perovskite nickelate films.

Significance and Impact

This research development enables new neuromorphic hardware for decision trees - powerful software tools that can support decision making in areas such as business, finance, risk management, healthcare, materials science and chemistry. 

Research Details

Nanoscale hard X-ray microscopy was used to image microscopic origins of operando valence switching behavior.

DFT and ab-initio MD simulations were used to understand mechanisms of proton transport in nickelates under e-fields.

The Center for Nanoscale Materials’s (CNM) Carbon HPC, the ALCF, and NERSC also were used.

Work was performed in part at CNM and the Advanced Photon Source.
