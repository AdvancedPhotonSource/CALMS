New AI-based tool for modeling materials at the atomic and molecular scale

May 13, 2022

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers report a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for developing molecular models that predict potential energy surfaces of elemental nanoclusters and bulk systems. 

A graphical summary of the discrete Monte Carlo tree search reinforcement learning approach, extended to continuous action space (c-MCTS). 

Scientific Achievement

Bond-order potentials were predicted and applied to cluster structure and dynamical stability for 54 different elemental systems and their alloys. This was made possible through reinforcement learning to develop a continuous action space Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (c-MCTS).

Significance and Impact

Similar modeling goals have relied heavily on human intuition and expertise, requiring years of efforts. This algorithm approach yields high quality data in just days and hours, with impact on many materials science and technology challenges.

Research Details

•This approach was benchmarked against other global optimization schemes.

•The calculations were primarily performed on the Carbon cluster of computers in CNM, Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, and National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.
