Ferroelectric domain wall motion in freestanding single-crystal complex oxide thin films

January 13, 2020

In a study published in Advanced Materials, researchers used microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques to examine the energy landscape of ferroelectric materials and the relationship between their electronic and structural orders.

The flip layer transfer (top) was shown to induce unique PZT domain kinetics correlated with a static nanoscale flexoelectric structure (bottom).

 Achievement

Ferroelectric domain wall kinetics of free-standing PZT films were found to be orders of magnitude slower than when bonded to a growth substrate.

Significance and Impact

The observation of unique domain wall kinetics was correlated with mesoscale structural ripples but found to be distinct from a simple release of epitaxial strain - suggesting new routes for structural control of flexoelectric ordering in complex oxides.

Research Details

This unique energy landscape for domain wall motion was observed after layer transfer by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM).

The structural origins of these kinetics were shown to be flexoelectricity induced by a nanoscale spatial distribution of lattice tilts imaged at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)/Advanced Photon Source (APS) Hard X-ray Nanoprobe.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
