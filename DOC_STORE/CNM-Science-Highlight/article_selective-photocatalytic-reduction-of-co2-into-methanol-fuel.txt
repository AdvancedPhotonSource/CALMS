Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into methanol fuel

November 12, 2019

In a study published in Nature Energy, researchers showed that catalytic reduction of CO2 using sunlight offers an efficient way to directly store solar energy in the form of the liquid chemical fuel methanol.

Transmission electron microscopy (a) and X-ray fluorescence images (b) of a single Cu₂O particle in conjunction with schematics of the electron and X-ray beam directions upon multimodal imaging (c). Atomic model of Cu₂O nanoparticle surface terminations (d) supports unique structure that enables electronic redistribution during exposure of Cu₂O particle with (110) termination to CO₂ and water and, subsequently, during illumination (e) while (100) surface remains inactive (f).

Scientific Achievement

Operando multimodal measurements and theoretical calculations were used to identify the active facets for CO2 reduction on Cu2O and exploit this to obtain high conversion efficiency and selectivity to methanol.

Significance and Impact

The results demonstrate catalytic reduction of CO2 using sunlight offers an efficient way to directly store solar energy in the form of the liquid chemical fuel methanol.

Research Details

Single-nanoparticle multimodal operando measurements at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) and the Advanced Photon Source (APS) were used to identify the facet-specific sites in Cu2O catalyst capable of selectively reducing CO2.

An internal quantum yield of 70% was determined for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel methanol.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
