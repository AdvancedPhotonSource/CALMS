Scientific Achievement

The first synthesis is reported of high-entropy two-dimensional layered sheets of carbide MXenes with four transition metals each (TiVNbMoC3 and TiVCrMoC3).

Significance and Impact

This work significantly expands the compositional variety of the MXene family and provides a method of designing 2D materials with tailored and tunable material properties for diverse potential applications.

Research Details

Synthesis was confirmed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

The Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) high-performance computing Carbon Cluster was used to compute the formation energies and explore the ability to synthesize high-entropy MAX phases.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
