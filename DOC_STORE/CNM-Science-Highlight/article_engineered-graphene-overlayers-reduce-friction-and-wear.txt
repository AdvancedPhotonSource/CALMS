January 13, 2020

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers investigated the underlying mechanisms that allow new graphene and silicon nitride lubricants to reduce friction and save energy in mechanical systems.

Scientific Achievement

A new type of graphene/silicon nitride bilayer overcoat (3-4 nm thick) reduces microscale friction and wear on flat surfaces relevant to mechanical systems; simulations reveal the underlying atomistic mechanism.

Significance and Impact

Small improvements in friction and wear can greatly impact energy savings in diverse applications from magnetic storage systems, and micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems to moving machine components.

Research Details

The origin of the reduced wear and friction was determined by atomic emission spectroscopy, ion mass spectrometry, and Raman spectroscopy by Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) users from National University of Singapore, and supported by atomistic simulations (molecular dynamics) performed at CNM.

Work was performed, in part, at CNM.
