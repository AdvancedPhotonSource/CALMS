September 19, 2022

In a report published in ACS Nano, researchers demonstrate a near-infrared nanolaser using a polymer microsphere as the microcavity and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes as the gain material.

Scientific Achievement

The first observation of lasing action from semiconducting carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was demonstrated by using a unique microcavity-emitter configuration.

Significance and Impact

This work has profound impact towards the development of compact, coherent light sources operating in the near-IR wavelength range that are critically needed in telecommunication, interconnects, and bio-imaging areas.

Research Details

A semiconductor nanolaser was developed using a polymer microsphere as the microcavity and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes as the gain material.

Room temperature near-IR lasing from the nanolasers was demonstrated and the lasing threshold was lowered by modifying the electronic structures of the gain through chemical modification.

 

Work was performed, in part, at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).
