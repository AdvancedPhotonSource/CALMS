Scientific Achievement

A design concept is presented for preparing stretchable electroluminescent polymers that can harness all the excitons formed through thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Fabrication involves embedding soft alkyl chains between TADF units in the polymer backbone.

Significance and Impact

Electroluminescent devices are already key to many modern technologies. Stretchable electroluminescent devices would be applicable to on-skin displays, optical sensors, wearable imaging systems, and more.

Research Details

Synthesized polymer films achieved near unity theoretical quantum yield (as opposed to only 25% for polymers based on single excitons), an external quantum efficiency of 10%, and a stretchability of 125%.
