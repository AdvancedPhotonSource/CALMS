Earth-abundant catalyst lowers cost for producing clean hydrogen by electrolysis with water

July 13, 2023

In a Science paper, researchers report developing a cobalt-based catalyst to replace the expensive iridium-based catalyst used in electrolyzers for hydrogen and oxygen separation from water.

Scientific Achievement

A nanofibrous cobalt spinel catalyst doped with La and Mn was developed to replace the expensive iridium-based catalyst presently used for oxygen evolution in water with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Such electrolyzers could run with renewable, intermittent energy, such as solar and wind.

Significance and Impact

An electrolyzer with this anode catalyst could produce clean, lower cost hydrogen for use in powering vehicles with fuel cells and as a chemical in industrial processes, such as steel making and ammonia production.

Research Details

A test electrolyzer with the anode catalyst achieved 2000 mA/cm2 at 2.47 V and exhibited low degradation.

Electron microscopy of the atomic structure on the catalyst at various stages of preparation was conducted at CNM.
