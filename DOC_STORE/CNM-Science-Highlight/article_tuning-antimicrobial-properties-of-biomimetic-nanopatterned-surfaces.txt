Tuning antimicrobial properties of biomimetic nanopatterned surfaces

June 11, 2018

In a study published in Nanoscale, Argonne researchers demonstrate, using a combination of microscopies, the mechanisms by which bacteria are killed, emphasizing the dependence upon pillar density and tip geometry.

Bactericidal efficiencies of black silicon of three nanopillar lengths towards four genera with 2 hr incubation. The longer black silicon pillars are sharper than the shorter pillars. The shorter/blunter pillars are more similar in dimension and spacing to the waxy protrusions on plants and insect wings that are responsible for keeping these surfaces free of microbes.

Scientific Achievement

Longer/sharper black silicon nanopillars up to 7 μm in length are effective against microbial species and exceed the performance of natural surface mimics by a factor of 2; shorter/blunter nanopillars <2 μm, however, selectively killed specific species.

Significance and Impact

The controlled variation of the features of biomimetics derived from etched black silicon allows for tuning of their antimicrobial efficacy.

Research Details

The Center for Nanoscale Materials capabilities employed included fabrication of the pillars in the clean room via reactive ion etching and also SEM and LSCM.

Bacterial cells viability tests were performed elsewhere at Argonne. Time-lapse confocal microscopy captured events  indicative of cellular immobilization and rupture.
