Scientific Achievement

A superconducting diode is dissipation-less and desirable for electronic circuits with ultralow power consumption. Such a device was achieved in a conventional super-conducting film patterned with a conformal array of nanoscale holes.

Significance and Impact

The switchable and reversible rectification signals can be three orders of magnitude larger than those from a flux-quantum diode.

Research Details

The superconducting diode effect is achieved in conventional MoGe superconducting films (50 nm thick) patterned with a conformal array of nanoscale holes (110 and 220 nm diameter) to break the spatial inversion symmetry.

The primary CNM capabilities used included optical and electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
