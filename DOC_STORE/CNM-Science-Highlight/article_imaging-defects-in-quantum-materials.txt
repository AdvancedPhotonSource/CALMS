Imaging defects in quantum materials

August 26, 2019

A unique route was demonstrated for directly imaging local strain in nanomechanical structures and quantifying dynamic structure-function relationships in materials.

Gaussian focused acoustic waves (top) enhanced photoluminescence from point defects near a fabricated scattering structure in SiC that was shown to correlate with dynamic lattice curvature measured through stroboscopic x-ray microscopy (bottom) determining optical response to acoustic dynamics.

Scientific Achievement

Dynamic strain was found to correlate with enhanced photoluminescence from optically active point defects used for solid-state qubits in 4H-SiC. Point defects in silicon carbide couple to strain, which can be used to tune the defect properties and coherently control spin states. Here the authors fabricate Gaussian-shaped surface acoustic wave transducers, develop a stroboscopic x-ray imaging method to measure dynamic lattice curvature, and observe its effects on the defect photoluminescence. Control of local lattice perturbations near optically-active defects in semiconductors is a key step to harnessing the potential of solid-state qubits for quantum information science and nanoscale sensing. The development of a stroboscopic scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy approach is reported for real-space imaging of dynamic strain used in correlation with microscopic photoluminescence measurements. This technique was demonstrated in 4H-SiC, which hosts long-lifetime room temperature vacancy spin defects. Using nano-focused X-ray photon pulses synchronized to a surface acoustic wave launcher, an effective time resolution of ~100 ps was achieved at a 25 nm spatial resolution to map micro-radian dynamic lattice curvatures. The acoustically induced lattice distortions near an engineered scattering structure are correlated with enhanced photoluminescence responses of optically-active SiC quantum defects driven by local piezoelectric effects.

Significance and Impact

Combining time-resolved optical and X-ray microscopy demonstrates a unique route for quantifying dynamic structure-function relationships in operando quantum materials. These results demonstrate a unique route for directly imaging local strain in nanomechanical structures and quantifying dynamic structure-function relationships in materials under realistic operating conditions.
