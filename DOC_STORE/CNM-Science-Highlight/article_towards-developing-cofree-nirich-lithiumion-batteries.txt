Towards developing Co-free Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries

March 8, 2021

In a study published in Nature Energy, researchers demonstrated nickel-rich cathode compositions for rechargeable batteries that are free of the costly element cobalt.

Scientific Achievement

In Ni-rich cathode materials, Co is found to be (a) more destructive than Ni at high potentials and (b) the cause for the structural instability and capacity decay. Mn substitution effectively alleviates the destructive effects of Co and enables a high potential functionality.

Significance and Impact

A series of Co-free cathodes with enhanced performance was presented as a viable research direction for next generation, low cost and long calendar life batteries in widespread applications.

Research Details

Materials characterization done with the Argonne chromatic aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the Talos TEM in the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Materials characterization also done with synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption near edge structure analyses at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
