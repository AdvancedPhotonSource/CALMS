Telomerase-activated probe for cancer diagnosis, treatment assessment and drug screening

March 31, 2023

In a paper appearing in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers report a telomerase-activated MRI probe that could be applicable to anticancer drug development and more.

Telomerase-activated MRI probe is based on the principle of distance-dependent magnetic resonance tuning. Right: Magnetic resonance images of telomerase activity in living mouse.

Scientific Achievement

A telomerase-activated probe has been developed based on distance-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It connects ferroferric oxide nanoparticles and Gd-DOTA (Gd(III) 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) complex via telomerase-responsive DNA motifs.

Significance and Impact

This probe provides deeper tissue penetration, consistent monitoring of tumor growth kinetics during progression and in response to drug treatment, and in situ screening of telomerase inhibitors in whole-animal models. Thus, the probe is an attractive tool for anticancer drug development.

Research Details

Telomerase is ribonucleoprotein that is low in healthy cells, but elevated by about 90% in cancer cells.

Gd-DOTA-conjugated oligonucleotides were liberated from the surface of ferroferric oxide nanoparticles via a DNA strand displacement, restoring the T1 signal of the Gd-DOTA for direct sensing of the telomerase activity.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
