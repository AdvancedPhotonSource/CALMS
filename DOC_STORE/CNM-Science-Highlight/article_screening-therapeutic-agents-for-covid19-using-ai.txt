Screening therapeutic agents for COVID-19 using AI

September 14, 2020

In a study published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, researchers using artificial intelligence identified 175 drugs as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.

Interface between the coronavirus S-protein and the human ACE2 receptor.

Scientific Achievement

75 FDA-approved and 100 other drugs were identified as potential therapeutics against COVID-19 using AI and ensemble docking studies. Promising chemical fragments and molecular descriptors were also found.

Significance and Impact

Screened drug candidates and identified chemical trends can guide future experiments against COVID-19. The general screening pathway of combining AI with theoretical/experimental techniques has potential for several chemical & materials problems.

Research Details

Machine learning (decision trees) was used to predict binding affinity of ligands to the virus and the virus-host interface.

Screened candidate ligands from several drug datasets were validated using expensive docking studies.

Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) Carbon HPC, the ALCF, and NERSC were used.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
