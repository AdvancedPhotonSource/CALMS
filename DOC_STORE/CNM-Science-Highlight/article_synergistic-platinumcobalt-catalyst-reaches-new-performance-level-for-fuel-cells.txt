Synergistic platinum-cobalt catalyst reaches new performance level for fuel cells

November 19, 2018

In a study published in Science, researchers describe a method of preparing highly active yet stable electrocatalysts containing ultralow Pt content using Co or Co/Zn zeolitic imidazolate frameworks.

Scientific Achievement

A synergistic, platinum-cobalt (Pt-Co) catalyst with high catalytic activity and durability at ultralow Pt loading was created for fuel cell applications; modeling confirmed Pt-Co interactions with the precious metal-free support play a significant role in the performance improvements.

Significance and Impact

The synergistic catalysts reached mass activities of 1.08-1.77 A mgPt-1 which exceed the 2025 U.S. DOE target of 0.44 A mgPt-1 for fuel cells.

Research Details

Design, synthesis and testing were performed in Argonne’s CSE Division; XAFS/XANES were performed at the APS.

Characterization at the CNM included aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with EDS and EELS; first-principles DFT modeling was performed on the CNM Carbon computing cluster.
