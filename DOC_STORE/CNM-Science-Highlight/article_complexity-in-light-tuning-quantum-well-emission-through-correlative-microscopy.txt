Complexity in light: tuning quantum well emission through correlative microscopy

September 9, 2019

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers demonstrated an advanced characterization toolkit for the investigation of semiconductor nanostructures.

(a) Birds-eye view scanning electron micrograph of the (In,Ga)As core–shell NW ensemble (sample A). Superimposed are monochromatic CL maps of the low-temperature QW emission at 1.35 and 1.39 eV (false color representation using linear intensity scales). The inset shows a top-view illustration of the core–shell geometry. (b) Micrograph of NW A1 together with a map of the crystal phase recorded by EBSD on the upper facet of this NW. (c) Sketch of the axial NW cross-section highlighting how the shell QW is grown on the core segments with different crystal structure. 

Scientific Achievement

Nanoscale variations of crystal polytype, strain and com-position in ternary (In,Ga)As quantum well nanostructures locally shift cathodoluminescence emission energy.

Significance and Impact

Crystal structure was found to have a role in tuning quantum well emission. Combining electron, X-ray and atom probe microscopy demonstrates a unique route for advanced nanoscale characterization of photonic heterostructures.

Research Details

Cathodoluminescence hyperspectral imaging revealed a blue-shift of emission energy in core-shell quantum well nanowires.

This shift was correlated with a local shift of indium revealed by atom probe tomography at Northwestern, and the presence of wurtzite/zincblende polytypes and local lattice strain were identified by the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)/Advanced Photon Source (APS) Hard X-ray Nanoprobe.

Work was performed in part at CNM and APS.
