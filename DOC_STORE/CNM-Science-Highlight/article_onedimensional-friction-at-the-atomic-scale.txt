One-dimensional friction at the atomic scale

August 5, 2021

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers investigated friction at the atomic scale.

STM images before and after manipulation of 6P on Ag(111).

Scientific Achievement

The lateral force required to move a 1D shape molecule in the direction parallel to its molecular axis is found to be about half of that required to move it sideways, due to frictional force anisotropy traced to the shape of the molecule.

Significance and Impact

The results unveil an atomic-scale frictional phenomenon that deviates from the linear relationship of friction based on contact areas between two objects. This work impacts the understanding of friction at the atomic scale.

Research Details

Sexiphenyl (6P) molecules were manipulated on a Ag(111) surface using q+AFM (at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)) and STM tips.

DFT calculations provided electronic structure while MD simulations revealed propagation of the molecules; both utilized the CNM Carbon computer cluster.

Work was performed in part at CNM.
