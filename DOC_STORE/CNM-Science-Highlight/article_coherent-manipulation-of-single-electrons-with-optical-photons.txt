Coherent manipulation of single electrons with optical photons

July 13, 2020

In a study published in Advanced Theory and Simulations, researchers simulated remarkably dynamic behaviors of single electrons in quantum liquids excited by laser pulses.

A single electron forms a nanometric quantum bubble in superfluid helium-4 and interacts with mid-infrared photons. An ultrafast laser pulse brings the electron onto quantum superpositions between the ground and excited states. The electron wavefunction deforms into a peanut shape or splits in two, displaying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.

Scientific Achievement

The remarkable nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of a single electron in a quantum liquid under the excitation of ultrafast laser pulses was computationally visualized.

Significance and Impact

The simulation predicts an optical approach to manipulate a single electron state from the femto- to pico-second time scale. It also suggests a new kind of single-electron-based quantum information system with optical addressability. 

Research Details

We performed real-time density functional simulation on the dynamic behaviors of a single electron in superfluid helium-4. 

We showed that a femtosecond laser pulse can drive the electron into Rabi oscillations and force the electron wavefunction to end up at various intriguing final states.

The Carbon cluster at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) was used for the simulation work.

Work was performed at CNM.
