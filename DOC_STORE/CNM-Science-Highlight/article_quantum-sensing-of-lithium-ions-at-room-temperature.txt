Quantum sensing of lithium ions at room temperature

January 15, 2023

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers achieved quantum sensing for quantifying chemical analytes in ambient conditions.

Chemical analytes are adsorbed into the MOF and interact with the embedded radicals through hyperfine coupling.

Scientific Achievement

Quantum sensing of lithium ions in solution is achieved at room temperature with an ensemble of organic radicals integrated in a microporous metal-organic framework (MOF).

Significance and Impact

The ability to apply quantum sensing for quantifying chemical analytes in ambient conditions could be instrumental for a range of technologies spanning biological systems and energy storage devices.

Research Details

Organic radicals exhibit electron spin coherence and microwave addressability at room temperature, thus behaving as qubits.

The high surface area of the MOF enables unambiguous identification of lithium ions and quantitative measurement of their concentration.

Work leveraged relaxometric and hyperfine spectroscopic methods based on electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.
