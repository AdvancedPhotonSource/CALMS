Topological kink plasmons demonstrated experimentally

November 12, 2019

In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers demonstrated kink magnetoplasmon (KMP) architecture could be generalized to more complex magnetic patterns useful for novel integrated topological circuits.

Scientific Achievement

For the first time, high-frequency topological kink modes — kink magnetoplasmons (KMPs) — have been demonstrated in a unique device featuring biased magnetic domains.

Significance and Impact

The demonstrated KMP architecture could be generalized to more complex magnetic patterns useful for novel integrated topological circuits.

Research Details

KMPs localized at the magnetic domain boundaries in a homogeneous two-dimensional electron gas were experimentally demonstrated.

Sample processing used a scanning electron-beam and focused ion beam system, and low-temperature sample characterization used a dilution refrigerator system; both systems are at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Work was performed in part at CNM.
