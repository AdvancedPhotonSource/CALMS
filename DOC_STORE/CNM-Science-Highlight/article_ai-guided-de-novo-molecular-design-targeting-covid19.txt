AI guided de novo molecular design targeting COVID-19

July 9, 2021

In a study published in ACS Omega, researchers used artificial intelligence to discover drug candidates that target COVID-19.

Hundreds of new therapeutic agents were generated and identified that outperform thousands of tested Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and non-FDA molecules.

Scientific Achievement

We present a de novo molecular design strategy that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Several hundred new drug candidates were identified with the potential to target COVID-19.

Significance and Impact

The new drug candidates outperform existing candidates against COVID-19. Further experiments can validate the in silico AI predictions.

Research Details

A Monte Carlo tree search algorithm combined with a multitask neural network surrogate model was used to generate the drug molecules.

Binding affinity of ligands to the virus and the virus-host interface were used as a descriptor.

The Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) Carbon High Performance Computing Cluster, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center were used.

Work was performed in part at the CNM.
