Unprecedented superelasticity in metallic single crystal

April 9, 2020

In a study published in Nature Materials, researchers demonstrated unprecedented superelasticity in a metallic crystal. The material could have applications in space and deep-sea exploration as well as robotics. 

Atomic entanglements of ordered and disordered crystal structures. a–c, Stripe areas from HRTEM images taken along zone axes. d, HRTEM of enlarged stripe taken along one axis. A partial collapse of the {111} planes along <111> direction of the body-centered cubic structure results in a motif of two structures shown by the magenta and blue rectangles.

Scientific Achievement

A NiCoFeGa alloy was shown to exhibit supercritical elasticity (15.2% strain) with no hysteresis, an entangled structure, high-energy-storage capability and stability over 8000 stress-strain cycles.

Significance and Impact

Because of its giant supercritical elasticity over a wide temperature range, this alloy has possible applications ranging from deep-space and deep-sea exploration to intelligent robotics.

Research Details

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), aberration-corrected TEM, and focused ion beam sample preparation were conducted at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Microscopy, combined with X-ray and neutron diffraction, reveal atomic entanglement of ordered/disordered crystal structures, which can be manipulated to tune superelasticity.

Work performed at CNM and the Advanced Photon Source.
