Characterization of just one atom using synchrotron X-rays

July 13, 2023

In a Nature paper, scientists report that they have determined both the elemental type and chemical state of single iron and terbium atoms using synchrotron X-rays.

(a) Nature magazine cover. (b) Single atom X-ray mechanism. (c) A supramolecular ring having only one Fe atom. (d) X-ray spectra of one Fe atom. (e) A terbium dimer complex. (f) X-ray spectra of one Tb atom. 

Scientific Achievement

For the first time since the discovery of X-rays in 1895, x-ray spectroscopy has been successfully performed on a single atom. Elemental types and chemical states of an iron and a terbium atom were simultaneously determined using synchrotron X-rays.

Significance and Impact

This work connects synchrotron X-rays to quantum tunneling process thereby enabling simultaneous detection of elemental and chemical states of an atom. Such ability may transform how scientists detect materials and impact research areas that include environmental, medical, and quantum information science.

Research Details

Research was performed at the XTIP beamline at the Advanced Photon Source and the Center for Nanoscale Materials.

Fe and Tb atoms were inserted in respective molecular hosts and the X-rays signatures were measured at 30 K using SX-STM.
