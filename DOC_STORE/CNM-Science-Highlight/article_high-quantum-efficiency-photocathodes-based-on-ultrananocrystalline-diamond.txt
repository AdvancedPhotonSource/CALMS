February 8, 2021

In a study published in Applied Physics Letters, researchers demonstrated high quantum efficiency in photocathodes of nitrogen-incorporated ultananocrystalline diamond at moderate vacuum.

Scientific Achievement

Nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond [N-UNCD] based photocathodes demonstrated high quantum efficiency (QE=4.2 x10-4), comparable intrinsic emittance (1.00 µm/mm), and durability (year-long atmospheric exposure) at moderate vacuum (10-9 torr).

Significance and Impact 

The demonstrated qualities together with high QE at UV wavelengths make N-UNCD a promising candidate for high brightness photoinjector applications.

Research Details

The incorporation of nitrogen at the grain boundary introduces sp2 rich graphitic carbon localized in between the sub-nm-scale (<10 nm) diamond grains enabling high electron emission

Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM) resources included a CVD-diamond system, electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy

Work was performed in part at CNM.
