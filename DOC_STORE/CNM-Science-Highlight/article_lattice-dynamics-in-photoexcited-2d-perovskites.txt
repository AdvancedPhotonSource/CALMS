Lattice dynamics in photoexcited 2D perovskites

February 24, 2023

In a report published in Advanced Materials, researchers investigated 2D perovskites using ultrafast transient X-ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics.

Two-dimensional, lead halide perovskites comprising inorganic octahedra separated by insulating organic spacers exhibit increased diffraction intensity ~1ns following photoexcitation that conveys increased ordering upon electron hole pair formation and lattice expansion. Recovery time conveys thermal relaxation.

Scientific Achievement

Directly measured picosecond thru microsecond lattice dynamics of 2-dimensional lead halide perovskite using transient X-ray diffraction following controlled-fluence pulsed laser excitation. Found atypical lattice response.

Significance and Impact

With high temporal and high Q-resolution, we observe anisotropic lattice evolution in multiple stages. These findings provide increased understanding of the interplay between structural and photophysical properties which is beneficial for use in optoelectronics.

Research Details

Samples were spun rapidly to prevent heating and damage.

Diffraction linewidths after excitation narrow, surprisingly, indicating increased crystal ordering upon electron-hole pair formation and thermal expansion.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials and the Advanced Photon Source, DOE Office of Science user facilities.
