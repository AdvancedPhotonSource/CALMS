Ultrafast exciton trapping in carbon nanotubes

February 10, 2020

In a study published in ACS Nano, researchers deepened their understanding of photodynamics. Their discoveries could inform design of brighter single photon sources for biological, quantum information and nanophotonic applications. 

Schematic representation of the pump-probe setup. An ultrafast near-infrared pump pulse is focused onto the sample, which is probed with a continuum pulse spanning the near-infrared.

Scientific Achievement

In covalently doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), ultrafast trapping of excitons at defect sites outpaces exciton diffusion, producing localization of excitons and a brighter single photon source.

Significance and Impact

These findings reveal critical information for the design of bright near-infrared emitters that can be utilized in biological, quantum information, and nanophotonic applications.

Research Details

Conducted ultrafast pump-probe and Raman studies at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM).

Simulated the carrier dynamics of the system and fit the data to a kinetic model, revealing an upper limit in quantum defect density for obtaining highly luminescent SWCNTs without causing irreversible damage.

Work was performed, in part, at CNM.
