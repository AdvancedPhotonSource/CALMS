Perovskite nanoplatelets show optical properties conducive to light-emitting technologies

April 25, 2023

In a Nano Convergence paper, scientists report that CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (less than three monolayers in thickness) have optical properties conducive to light-emitting technologies

(a) Summary of optical anisotropy results for nanoplatelets (NPLs) and nanocrystals (NCs). Bar graphs show photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and transient absorption (TA) data. Anisotropy decreases with number of monolayers (MLs). (b) Plot of theoretical data for photoselection anisotropy of an ensemble of two-dimensional emitters with larger, degenerate dipole strength in-plane or, equivalently, circular-polarized optical transitions.

Scientific Achievement

This work determined the anisotropic optical properties

of perovskite (CsPbBr3) nanoplatelets (NPLs) with different thicknesses using photoselection methods. The data revealed that thinner nanoplatelets -- three monolayers and less -- have absorption and emission transitions that are strongly plane-polarized. Anisotropy decreases with number of monolayers

Significance and Impact

Dominant planar emission is a valuable asset for improving the efficiency of light-emitting technologies.

Research Details

Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated that the band-edge absorption and emission for ensembles of the NPLs exceeds 0.08, approaching the theoretical value of perfect in-plane polarization of 0.1.

Work was performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Materials.
