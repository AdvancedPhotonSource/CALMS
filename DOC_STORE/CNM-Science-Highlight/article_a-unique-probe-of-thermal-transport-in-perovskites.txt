A unique probe of thermal transport in perovskites

June 11, 2018

In a recent study published in Nature Communications, researchers at the Center for Nanoscale Materials shed light on the design of materials that exhibit highly anisotropic thermal dissipation properties.

Coherent lattice distortions in 2D crystalline perovskites

Scientific Achievement

Probing of thermal transport using coherent acoustic phonons in 2-dimensional perovskite materials – promising semiconductors for next-generation optoelectronics – was developed, and large thermal impedance mismatching effects were characterized.

Significance and Impact

Mechanisms and rates of thermal transport in intimately intermixed, disparate, nanoscopic sublattices remain poorly investigated and can impact optoelectronic properties.

Research Details

The Center for Nanoscale Materials capabilities employed were: femtosecond transient reflection measurements, band structure calculations on HPC Carbon, SEM and XRD.

Sample synthesis, processing, and structural characterization was performed at Northwestern University.
