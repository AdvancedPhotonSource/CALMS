November 19, 2018

In a study published in Nano Letters, researchers highlight the versatility of the Si-BP material platform for creating optically active devices in integrated silicon chips.

Schematic of the hybrid device. Light emitted from the nanomaterial couples into, and is enhanced by, the silicon optical resonator. Inset, atomic structure of the few-layer nanomaterial.

Scientific Achievement 

We created a hybrid device composed of a silicon resonator cavity coupled to a layered nanomaterial, phosphorene, that performed as an optical emitter at near-infrared telecommunications wavelengths.

Significance and Impact

There is commercial interest in a silicon-compatible laser for photonic integrated circuits as an optical analog of microelectronics. The work demonstrates a hybrid silicon-nanomaterial platform for creating optically-active devices in integrated silicon chips.

Research Details

The nanomaterial properties required to optically emit in the near-infrared telecommunications wavelengths were isolated.
