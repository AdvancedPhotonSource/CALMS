      "The primary objective of our experiments is to maximize the electrical conductivity of \n",

      "At the start of our autonomous experiment, 30 conditions were uniformly sampled from \n",
      "the search space using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method (Supplementary section 2.1). \n",
      "These data points coarsely cover a wide region of the search space and serve as initial training data \n",
      "for the prediction models: a Gaussian processes regression (GPR) model for electrical conductivity \n",
      "(Supplementary section 2.2) and a Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE) model for film \n",
      "defects (Supplementary section 2.3). The GPR model predicts electrical conductivity of thin films \n",
      "based on all experimental parameters whereas the KDE model estimates a percentage of the thin \n",
      "film coverage area on the substrate prior to post -processing steps. This estimation is based on th e \n",
      "top three important experimental parameters identified by Shapley feature importance analysis of the training data: DMSO concentration, blade -coating temperature, and blade -coating velocity \n",
      "(Supplementary section 3.2, Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table s 4&5). Notably, the film \n",
      "coverage was reliably predicted using the train data alone, likely due to their relatively uniform \n",
      "distribution within the training data (Fig. 3a). From the GPR predicted values while considering \n",
      "data scarcities, Polybot evaluates the  expected improvements (EI) in electrical conductivity for all \n",

      "traps arise from EI overly focusing on the estimated improvemen ts.38 To alleviate this while \n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Uncapping and Capping**: The code uses `c9.uncap` and `c9.cap` with specific parameters. Verify that these functions are part of the approved operations and that the parameters are correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pipette Handling**: The code uses `proc.new_pipette` and `proc.remove_pipette`. Ensure these functions are part of the approved operations and are used correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Coating and Annealing**: The code sets the coating speed and temperature, and anneals the films. Ensure these operations are performed using the correct functions and parameters as per the approved methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Post-Processing**: The code mentions post-processing with a methanol/ethanol mixture but does not provide a function for applying the solvent mixture. Ensure that the correct function is used for this step.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sequence of Operations**: Ensure the sequence of operations is correct, such as moving the substrate to the coating stage before picking up the vial, and dropcasting the polymer onto the substrate before starting the blade coating.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to manage any potential issues during the execution of the robotic operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Verification of Parameters**: Double-check all parameters (e.g., temperatures, speeds, volumes) against the manuscript to ensure they are correctly implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Comments and Documentation**: The code should include comments explaining each step, especially if certain functions or parameters are specific to the robotic system being used.\n",
