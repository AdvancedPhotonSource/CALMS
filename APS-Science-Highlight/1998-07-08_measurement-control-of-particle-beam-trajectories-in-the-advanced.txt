Measurement & Control of Particle-Beam Trajectories in the Advanced Photon Source Storage Ring

The orbit stability requirements for the APS storage ring were specified during the accelerator-design phase. In order to provide stable x-ray beams, the rms beam motion must be less than 5% of the particle-beam dimensions at the source point.
