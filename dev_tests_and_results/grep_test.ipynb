But because liquid sprays are difficult to image, particularly in the region close to the nozzle, high-pressure fuel sprays have never been considered as supersonic under typical fuel injection conditions.', '', 'At SRI-CAT (Advanced Photon Source) and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, synchrotron x-radiography and a fast x-ray detector were used to record the time evolution of transient fuel sprays from a high-pressure injector, capturing the propagation of spray-induced shock waves in a gaseous medium and revealing the complex nature of the spray hydrodynamics. The x-radiographs also allow quantitative analysis of shock waves that is nearly impossible with optical imaging. Under injection conditions similar to those found in operating engines, the fuel jets can exceed supersonic speeds and result in gaseous shock waves. This work sets the stage for study of the entire range of fluid dynamics inside and close to high-pressure liquid sprays. The methods used here may also be applied to the characterization of highly transient phenomena in optically dense materials.', '', 'Andrew G. MacPhee(1), Mark W. Tate (3), Christopher F.

The time required for this process can vary from a fraction of a second to many hours depending on the concentration of the particles and the strength of their attraction for one another. This sensitivity creates a scientific challenge that is central to the field of soft matter but also an opportunity for designing suspensions with properties tailored for specific applications, such as those noted above. The researchers studied this transformation from fluid to gel in aqueous suspensions of nanometer-scale silica particles. Taking advantage of newly developed x-ray scattering capabilities and the ability to precisely tune the strength of the particle attractions, the scientists were able to track the evolution in the microscopic organization and mobility of the particles and correlate these properties with the time-dependent macroscopic mechanical behavior of the suspensions. They found that the rate of gel formation is surprisingly sensitive to the strength of attraction, but that the suspensions proceed through identical intermediate states of microscopic and macroscopic behavior even as the time needed to form a gel varies by orders of magnitude. To explain these observations, they propose a model of gel formation in the regime of weak attraction in which network formation is a hierarchical process whose initiation depends on the creation and stability of small clusters in which the particles arrange in particularly favorable configurations.', '', 'The intermediate concentration gels that the researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, AGH University of Science and Technology (Poland), and Johns Hopkins University chose to study are particularly intriguing because there remain many unanswered questions about the mechanisms by which such gels form from a suspension of rapidly diffusing constituent nanoparticles. The left panels of Fig. 1 are pictures of a colloidal nanoparticle suspension like the one the researchers studied. The upper left picture is the suspension in its fluid state while the lower left is it in its gelled state. The gelled suspension appears milky and does not fall out of the test tube because of the formation of a large-scale mechanically rigid structure in the gel.', '', 'For the reasons outlined above, gels have been studied for many years utilizing a variety of experimental techniques such as confocal microscopy and light, neutron, and x-ray scattering, as well as via simulation tools such as molecular dynamics. In particular, previous x-ray photon correlation (XPCS) studies performed at the APS [H. Guo et al., J. Chem. Phys. 135, 154903 (2011)], were able to examine slower formation and aging behavior of gels, but were unable to reveal how the colloids in suspension transitioned from a fluidized state at higher temperatures to an almost fully immobile state in the gel. XPCS measures fluctuating coherent scattering patterns to provide information about motion in materials at the nanoscale. To date, a key shortcoming of the technique has been limited detector speed that restricts the range of fluctuations that can be measured.', '', 'To address this shortcoming, the current experiment team worked closely with pixel-array x-ray detector developers at the AGH University of Science and Technology to commission and then deploy the world’s first XPCS-suitable (ultrafast, x-ray-photon-counting, pixel-array detector, or UFXC) area detector for measurements at the X-ray Science Division 8-ID-I beamline at the APS, which is an Office of Science user facility at Argonne. The detector is nearly ten times faster than any device available on the commercial market and provided the researchers with an unprecedented view of the early stages of gel formation.', '', 'To obtain information about the formation of the gel, the researchers started with the nanoparticle suspension at a higher temperature, when it is in its fluidized state, and then rapidly quenched it to temperatures at which a gel forms. The UFXC detector was then used to repeatedly measure “video clips” of the gel formation as a function of time after the quench to lower temperature was complete. The right panels of Fig. 1 show the time-average coherent scattering patterns measured just after (upper right) and well after (lower right) a quench. The upper-right pattern is smooth or blurred because the constituent nanoparticles were moving rapidly during the data collection period while the lower-right pattern is speckled or grainy, because the nanoparticles are now mostly frozen in position.', '', 'The coherent scattering patterns collected by the UFXC can be used to measure the dynamic properties (the so-called time autocorrelation decay functions) of the nanoparticle suspension as a function of time after it has been quenched into the gel-forming regime. Fig. 2 shows autocorrelation functions for three such quenches. Squares are the correlation points for a 1.5-K quench below the gel temperature while the circles and diamonds are for 1.25-K and 1.0-K quenches. The curve labelled A was obtained soonest after the quench, while that labelled G was obtained latest. The time scale of the decay from the maximum amplitude of the traces on the left to the minimum on the right provides a measure of how dynamic the nanoparticles are. Soon after the quench (A curves), the decay is rapid, indicating motion of small clusters of nanoparticles while long after the quench (G curves), the decay is incomplete indicating that the nanoparticle motion has largely been arrested and that the gel is nearly fully formed. The illustrations in the lower left and upper right of Fig. 2 are schematic illustrations of the microscopic state of the suspension at these two extremes of observed behavior.', '', 'The most intriguing part of the research performed by the team was the finding that the shapes that the correlation decays exhibit as the gel forms after the quench are identical irrespective of the quench temperature, i.e., each curve (A–G) is comprised of points from different quenches that lie atop one another. The only difference observed between the behavior of different quench temperatures was how long after the quench the scientists had to wait to observe an overlapping correlation function. For instance, curve D in Fig. 2 was measured 658 s after the quench to 1.5 K below the gel temperature (squares), while curve D was also measured after 1156 s and 1856 s, respectively, for 1.25-K and 1.0-K quenches. Similar observations were also made using a rheometer that measures the solid-like nature of the suspension and also by carefully examining the time-average scattering patterns like those presented in the right panels of Fig. 1.', '', 'This work suggests that gel formation occurs via the formation of highly favored small clusters of nanoparticles like those illustrated schematically in the lower left of Fig. 2, and via relatively slow diffusion; the clusters interact and form a space-spanning gel structure like that shown schematically in the upper right of Fig. 2. The work provides important insight into a key question that has long puzzled scientists in the field, namely, why do nanoparticle gels take so long to form after a quench even though the constituent nanoparticles are rapidly diffusing through the suspension? The UFXC detector provided the team with a unique opportunity to observe the early formation process of a gel and demonstrated that with the right tools, XPCS at markedly faster time scales will be possible with the dramatic gains in coherent flux that proposed APS Upgrade will provide.', '', 'See: Qingteng Zhang1, Divya Bahadur2, Eric M.

Such materials are called elastic solids. In contrast, amorphous solids respond quite differently when deformed. Amorphous solids are substances like pastes, gels, and glasses that lack any long-range crystalline structure. When these materials are subjected to deformation (strain) the restoring force (stress) does not remain constant but slowly decreases over time, a process called stress relaxation. Although such behavior has been extensively studied at the macroscopic scale, investigations of the microscopic phenomena driving the large-scale behavior have lagged behind. In response, scientists recently performed first-of-their-kind experiments that tracked particle motion in a soft glass using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) performed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), while simultaneously observing how stress and strain varied with time. These complementary measurements revealed that following deformation of the soft glass, a persistent, microscopic backward flow was observed along with intermittent surges of particle motion perpendicular to the back flow. These experimental results may guide new strategies for processing amorphous solids and could also provide new theoretical insights into the factors underlying their dynamic behavior.', '', 'The amorphous solid examined in this research was a model system referred to as a “soft glass,” which consisted of densely packed silica (silicon dioxide) nanospheres in water. The surfaces of the nanospheres were charged, causing them to repel one another and become jammed in a static, disordered configuration. Macroscopically, the soft glass had a consistency similar to mayonnaise.', '', \"To examine the deformation and flow behavior of liquids and amorphous solids, scientists typically employ specialized laboratory equipment such as rheometers. This study, by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Ottawa (Canada) utilized a rheometer that incorporated a device called a Couette cell, which consisted of two coaxial cylinders. In a Couette cell a sample is placed in the gap between the walls of the cylinders and then the inner cylinder is rotated at precise speeds. The rotation introduces a tangential stress, or shearing force, across the sample's surface, which deforms it.\", '', 'The soft glass was placed in the Couette cell and subjected to sudden deformations after which the torque needed to maintain the deformation was monitored as a function of time. More specifically, the strain (deformation) in the soft glass was increased stepwise from zero up to a maximum predetermined value and then held constant, and the resulting stress (force) needed to maintain that maximum strain was measured. The required stress was initially large but slowly decreased over time.', '', 'The innovative aspect of this study entailed using the highly-intense synchrotron x-rays produced at the APS to view the motion of the glassy nanospheres during simultaneous operation of the rheometer. A series of experiments was performed by the team and a colleague from Argonne National Laboratory \\xa0over two days, employing the X-ray Science Division Dynamics & Structure Group’s 8-ID-I x-ray beamline at the APS, an Office of Science user facility at Argonne National Laboratory. Each experiment lasted 1000 seconds, or nearly 17 minutes. To track movement in the soft glass, XPCS images in the form of time varying speckle patterns were captured 10 times per second, resulting in a total of 10,000 x-ray images per experiment.', '', 'The XPCS measured two types of motion in the soft glass during stress relaxation. One component to the motion was parallel to the cylinder wall and in the direction opposite to the initial deformation, hence its description as a back flow. This motion was captured by smoothly-varying XPCS correlation functions, as illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 1. The researchers were surprised at the persistent nature of the back flow, which steadily slowed over time but lasted throughout the entire duration of the experiments. The back flow was intimately linked with the rate of stress relaxation in the soft glass, and its detailed behavior was unexpected in light of previous computer simulations used to predict soft glass dynamics.', '', 'The other observed motion consisted of intermittent surges, or avalanches, perpendicular to the back flow. This perpendicular orientation is called the vorticity direction. Irregular changes in the XPCS correlation functions can highlight such intermittent motion, as illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 1. The researchers attributed these surges to coordinated motion of the jammed nanospheres in the vorticity direction to accommodate the back flow. The researchers suspect that the perpendicular flow observed in the soft glass may likewise occur in many amorphous solids.', '', 'The unique experimental setup utilized in this study will undoubtedly prove useful in future studies to uncover the microscopic mechanisms of deformation and flow in a wide variety of soft materials. The APS Upgrade would boost the coherent flux by 100 times and further enable the imaging of speckles to yield transformational insight into such studies.\\xa0 ― Philip Koth', '', 'See: Yihao Chen1, Simon A.

Keys to performing such measurements are a partially coherent x-ray beam and a high-frame-rate area detector with spatial resolution sufficient to resolve the finely-featured interference pattern that is obtained when making such measurements. The upcoming APS Upgrade (APS-U) makes the need for high-frame-rate detectors especially acute because the tremendous gains in coherent flux will, in principle, increase the best time resolution of XPCS by 4 orders of magnitude, allowing measurements of nanoscale fluctuations in aqueous environments such as those relevant to biochemical function [1]. To achieve such gains in practice, however, requires detectors with frame rates far higher than those available from commercially available pixel-array-detectors (PADs), which are currently limited to 9 kHz or slower.', '', 'With this goal in mind, scientists in the XSD Time Resolved Research Group at beamline 8-ID-I of the APS established a collaboration with colleagues at the AGH University of Science and Technology (Poland) to apply the ultrafast x-ray camera (UFXC) to XPCS measurements. In 2016, the team demonstrated the applicability of this detector to XPCS with 11-kHz frame rates [2] and subsequently demonstrated 50-kHz frame rates in 2017 [3].

Following these two events, the cycle repeated itself. The timing for this mode is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1(b).\\xa0', '', 'By merging otherwise identical measurements made at 50 kHz, 390 kHz, and 1.2 MHz, the team demonstrated time sensitivity to nanoscale fluctuations extending continuously from 826 ns to 60 s, or nearly 8 decades in time. Particularly noteworthy is that the 1.2-MHz frame rate corresponds to an exposure time of less than the transit time of an electron bunch around the APS storage ring, which is a significant advance toward the goal of resolving the scattering signal from individual electron bunches in the storage ring that are currently spaced 153 ns apart.', '', 'As a demonstration of burst-mode operation, the team made measurements of the fluctuating interference pattern resulting from the Brownian motion of 57-nm-radius silica nanoparticles in water. Figure 2 shows the coherent x-ray scattering intensity in a single 826-ns exposure (1.2 MHz), demonstrating how sparse the data is from the APS today; the signal will improve by 2-to-3 orders of magnitude with the APS-U. Despite the sparse data, a high-quality correlation function can be calculated and is shown in Fig. 3, which presents results obtained by combining correlation decays measured in 1.2-MHz and 390-kHz burst modes with that obtained in 50-kHz continuous mode. The accuracy of the measurements on this model system was checked by fitting the time scale of the exponential decays as a function of inverse length-scale sensitivity that is referred to as the wave vector transfer, or Q.', '', 'The results, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3, agree well with the anticipated inverse-length-scale-squared scaling, as first derived by Einstein.\\xa0', '', 'Despite the impressive achievement demonstrated with what is now the fastest XPCS area detector in the world, the sparse signal level illustrated in Fig. 2 makes the practical application of this detector to many systems today a significant challenge.

They are disturbed by wind, and they are always decorated with waves caused by thermal fluctuations. At short wavelengths, these waves are governed by the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid and are called capillary waves. For highly viscous, or syrupy, liquids—in the case of this subject, polymer melts—these waves are overdamped, their amplitude reduced. Hydrodynamic theory can predict how the relaxation time depends on the wavelength of the capillary wave. This relation can in turn be used to determine the viscosity of thin liquid films.', '', 'In this experiment, the researchers measured the over-damped relaxation time of the capillary waves as a function of wavelength, molecular weight (MW), thickness, and temperature. The results showed that at high temperatures, hydrodynamic theory was very well obeyed, with liquid viscosities in good agreement with those obtained from bulk zero shear viscosities through rheological measurements.', '', 'As the films cooled down toward the glass transition temperature (Tg, the temperature at which an amorphous solid—such as glass or a polymer—becomes brittle on cooling or soft on heating), the simple exponential relaxation of the surface capillary waves was replaced by so-called “stretched exponential relaxation,” which is usually a manifestation of a distribution of relaxation times, as various dynamical modes began to freeze out. In this region, a single viscosity could not be extracted using conventional hydrodynamic theory.', '', 'However, when temperatures on the order of a few degrees above the glass transition temperature were reached, pure exponential relaxation behavior was again observed, implying that most of the other relaxation processes had frozen out on the time-scale of the measurements—except one.', '', 'Remarkably, applying hydrodynamic theory to these relaxation times yielded viscosities for the larger MW\\xa0polymer chains values orders of magnitude smaller than what would have been inferred from bulk measurements of the viscosity. Equally remarkable was the discovery that these viscosities turned out to be independent of molecular weight down to a critical molecular weight (MC) of ~30,000 g/mol, which is the average molecular weight of polystyrene chains in a melt between entanglement points, or the so-called “entanglement molecular weight.”', '', 'The viscosity measured for films of all molecular weights greater than Mc\\xa0at these temperatures were, as might be expected, equal to the viscosity of the liquid with chains of molecular weight equal to critical molecular weight. For polystyrene melts with chains of MW<MC, the viscosities measured with XPCS were equal to those measured in bulk rheological measurements and decreased with MW\\xa0as expected.', '', 'The picture that emerges from these measurements is of a gradual freezing out of the various dynamical modes of the chains, such as the famous reptation modes via which a polymer chain diffuses in a bulk melt, until at the lowest temperatures, only the modes of those portions of chains between entanglements are fluctuating (at least on the time scale of the measurements), until these too freeze out near Tg.', '', 'This interpretation is consistent with the famous “time-temperature” plots of the loss modulus G″(ω) measured for bulk polymers as a function of frequency. Capillary wave relaxation measurements carried out with XPCS probe the liquid viscosity over a given time scale (~1-1000 s) and over rather short length scales (on the order of ~nm). At temperatures well above Tg, this time scale corresponds to the low-frequency end of the so-called “terminal regime” and the viscosity is determined by the diffusion of the polymer chains along the virtual tubes formed by topological constraints, as in De Gennes’ famous reptation model. At lower temperatures, the so-called “transition regime” moves down into the window of time scales probed, and the viscosity is determined by the Rouse diffusion of the segments between entanglements only, which explains the independence of the relaxation times for MW\\xa0> MC.', '', 'A universal scaling behavior was also discovered for these capillary wave relaxations. Regardless of the entanglement, thickness, or temperature, all the data are collapsed onto a simple scaling curve corresponding to a uniform density layer. This puts a strong constraint on the currently popular bilayer hypothesis, which attempts to explain the observed reduced glass transition temperature of supported polymer films by assuming a more mobile surface layer.', '', 'Conventional rheological techniques, which are usually used for bulk samples, do not have the capability to measure viscoelastic properties in film geometries. However, thermally excited surface capillary waves, which arise from the molecular arrangements throughout the entire film and therefore are encoded with hydrodynamics of the polymers, serve as a novel and unique tool to understand the viscoelastic behaviors when combined with non-invasive scattering techniques.

The brilliant green of a butterfly wing or the shimmering gold from a beetle shell are often due to arrays of nanoscale structures that scatter light only at specific wavelengths and at certain angles. A new study has cataloged the vast variety of structural color mechanisms in insects, as well as spiders. Using the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS), the researchers show that the so-called “photonic nanostructures” in these organisms have shapes similar to self-organizing membrane structures found inside cells, as well as in detergents, and certain polymers. But unlike artificial polymeric nanostructures, these biophotonic nanostructures achieve the large sizes necessary to scatter visible light. If engineers can learn to imitate the way insects create structural color, they may be able to improve the performance of light-manipulating devices, including fiber optics and solar cells.', '', 'Structural colors arise when multiple objects in a material scatter light, causing constructive or destructive interference of different wavelengths. These light scattering objects – which could be multilayers in a shell, air bubbles in a feather barb, or crystal-like arrays on a wing scale – work differently than molecular pigments that selectively absorb certain wavelengths while reemitting others. Few animal pigments can produce shorter wavelength blue and green colors Because of this, many insects rely on structural coloration to produce blues that will make them visible to potential mates and greens to conceal them from predators. However, structural colors in insects cover the entire spectrum, from violet to red. \\xa0', '', 'Although many studies have investigated structural colors in insects, the focus has typically been on one or a few species. Researchers from Yale University, Yale-NUS College (Singapore), CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences (Australia), and Argonne performed the first comprehensive survey of structural color in arthropods (the phylum that includes insects and spiders). Working at X-ray Science Division beamline 8-ID-I at the Argonne APS, which is an Office of Science user facility, as well as the SAXS/WAXS beamline of the Australian Synchrotron, and beamline I22 of the Diamond Light Source (UK), the team performed small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements on 140 samples coming from nearly 100 species of longhorn beetles and weevils, several kinds of bees and spiders, and one butterfly. Butterflies structural colors were the subject of previous study by these authors using 8-ID-I (Saranathan et al., 2010, Proc. Nattl. Acad. Sci.

In the experiments, synchrotron light scatters off the interfaces between chitin and air. Since the sizes of these structures are roughly 100s of nanometers across, the short wavelength x-rays (roughly 0.1 nanometers) only scatter over very tiny angles (on the order of microradians). APS beamline 8-ID-I is one of the few facilities in the world that can record this small-angle scattering.\\xa0', '', 'The SAXS data showed that the photonic nanostructures in insects and spiders appear in a wide variety of different morphologies, such as diamond lattices, single network gyroids, close-packed spheres, honey-combed columns, and sponge-like networks (see the figure). These morphologies are analogous to membrane structures that appear both in biology and industry. Certain molecules, like fatty lipid molecules in a cell or surfactants in detergents, can self-assemble into different nanoscale shapes. Engineers produce similar elements with long Lego-like molecules, called block copolymers, but the size of these artificial structures is limited by the length of the polymer chains ( no bigger than 50 nanometers). Insects assemble photonic nanostructures that are five to ten times larger than this, so maybe we can learn some design strategies by studying insect structural colors.', '', 'The authors note that cells produce several types of membrane shapes with the help of membrane-binding proteins. Perhaps insects have co-opted this molecular membrane-bending machinery to produce their photonic nanostructures. The researchers hypothesize that during insect development, membranes in the outer scale cells form a kind of nanostructure template, within which the biopolymer chitin fills in. When the scale cells eventually die, the chitin remains — shaped with color-producing nanostructures.

Their results were published in the journal ACS Nano.', '', 'The researchers used gold nanoparticles with an average diameter of 14.3 ± 1.7 nm, which they functionalized by adding ligands of heptaethylene glycol with carboxylic acid on the end, making it easier to hold them at the interface between water and oil. When the researchers changed the shape of the liquid, the interface between the water and oil decreased, and the nanoparticles were jammed together, making them immobile and turning them essentially into a dense, disordered film. The jammed nanoparticles then provided structural support for the liquid to hold its shape. Altering the chemistry of one or both liquids gives the scientists control over its behavior and function, and the nanoparticles themselves can have optical, electrical, or magnetic properties that researchers can take advantage of when designing a device.', '', 'To view the dynamics of the nanoparticles’ movement and assembly, the researchers used grazing incidence small-angle x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, which they performed at the APS X-ray Science Division Dynamics & Structure Group’s x-ray beamline 8-ID-I at the APS, a Department of Energy Office of Science user facility at Argonne National Laboratory. Because the x-ray beam from that beamline is coherent, the x-rays striking the sample at a small angle show a frequency shift that can be used to measure the motion of the particles. They chose gold nanoparticles because gold provides a high x-ray contrast that allowed them to perform the experiment with great accuracy. They could measure motions over distances from 10 nm to nearly a micrometer, with each measurement lasting tens of seconds (Fig. 1).

They saw that the speed at which the nanoparticles move changes as they congregate at an interface. As the particles cluster at the surface of the liquids, they slow down, and the speed at which they relax to an equilibrium state is five orders of magnitude slower than for free particles. When the interface is almost completely full of particles, jamming takes over, and the time for relaxation increases suddenly. After that, the dynamics slow exponentially, until the particles gradually rearrange themselves so that the whole system is collectively jammed.

Some materials scientists, meanwhile, look to nature to find better ways to recreate such colors. A study conducted using the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) and published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America points to possible answers to both those questions. This discovery represents the first directly self-assembled single gyroid crystals known to science. The researchers say the results are not only unexpected, but also happen to be highly relevant to current challenges in the engineering of complex nanostructures for advanced applications, potentially opening new photonic technologies.', '', 'The bird in this case is the blue-winged leafbird (Chloropsis cochinchinensis), a brightly colored species found only in Asia. Like many animals, the color comes not from pigments, but from an ordered crystal structure in the leafbird’s feathers, which is quite unusual for birds. These photonic crystals, consisting of the structural protein beta-keratin and air, are arranged in a shape known as a single gyroid and of a size scale—roughly 300 nm—that they interact with wavelengths of visible and ultraviolet light. The interfaces between air and protein form a repeating series of changes in refractive index, leading to the feathers’ colors.', '', 'Single gyroid crystals are rare. The same researchers discovered the first one in biology in 2010 within the iridescent green scales of certain butterflies, also using the APS, and now in the feathers of only one of 10,000 bird species. The researchers say these crystals are unusual given the way birds normally grow their feather nanostructures. This process seems to resemble the way foam forms in beer, when dissolved carbon dioxide forms bubbles that push their way to the surface. In the case of the feathers, water and beta-keratin undergo phase separation to form the single gyroid, and once the water evaporates the structure of air and protein is left behind.', '', 'This is very different from the way either butterflies or engineers create single gyroid crystals. Engineers can make larger crystals, then apply heat to shrink them to a size where they work with wavelengths of visible light, but it’s difficult to do that at useful volumes, and the process can lead to defects. Taking a cue from the birds, humans might instead develop a process that relies on self-assembly to create the crystals. Those could then be used to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells, optical fibers, or catalysts.', '', 'To study the evolution of the nanostructures, the researchers compared them to nanostructures in related species of birds. They found that the ordered single gyroid structure evolved from a quasi-ordered state. The more ordered versions produce more saturated or purer hues that the birds can easily perceive. That suggests that the evolution of these structures was driven by sexual selection, where birds with more brilliant coloration were seen as more desirable mates.', '', 'To reveal the crystalline structure, the scientists performed synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) at the X-ray Science Division Dynamics & Structure Group’s beamline 8-ID-I at the DOE Office of Science’s APS at Argonne National Laboratory.

The resulting flexible composite forms a lightweight, yet strong material that is of considerable commercial interest. Examples over the last century include the clay-reinforced resin used in common household goods (“bakelite”), nanoparticle-toughened rubber for automobiles, and mica-reinforced nylon with a five-fold increase in yield and tensile strength. The growing availability of nanoparticles with precise size and shape and properties, combined with the development of high-resolution characterization techniques, has spurred even greater interest in nanoparticle-polymer composites, which have potential applications in aerospace, defense, transportation, biomaterials, and energy storage and conversion. A team of researchers exploited the power of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Photon Source (APS) as a means of tracking, for the first time, the motion of a high concentration of silica nanoparticles in polymer melts relevant to commercial polymer nanocomposite applications. Motion of nanoparticles in polymeric melts has so far been investigated only in the dilute nanoparticle regime due to the challenges in dispersing nanoparticles in polymer melts at high volume fractions and the sensitivity of the particle dynamics to the morphology of the resulting aggregates.', '', 'At present, development of polymer melt materials is hampered by a lack of understanding of the reinforcement mechanism, which is much debated. Most of the previously proposed reinforcement mechanisms focus on polymer mobility in the presence of nanoparticles. However, since the reinforcement is a combined effect of polymer, particle, and the interphases in between, understanding how particle motion is affected as the nanocomposite gets stronger is equally important.', '', 'To begin, the team of researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the University of Maryland, and Argonne National Laboratory took advantage of the favorable interaction between polymer and nanoparticles to prepare a uniform dispersion of silica nanoparticles in a polyethylene oxide melt with a particle volume fraction up to 42%. In preparing this material, they dissolved the polyethylene oxide in acetonitrile solvent and added silica nanoparticles into the polymer solution. The mixtures were then sonicated and vigorously stirred. Finally, the samples were dried under a fume hood, annealed above the melting temperature of the polymer for solvent removal, and molded to sizes of 1-mm diameter and 0.8-mm thickness. The resulting composite samples had particle volume fractions of 2.5% to 42%. Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at X-ray Science Division beamline 8-ID-I of the APS, an Office of Science user facility, the team was able to follow the slow nanoscale motion of the nanoparticles (“relaxation”) in the polymer composites over a length scale of 20-200 nanometers and time scale of 10 milliseconds to 2000 seconds.', '', 'At the lowest concentrations of 2.5%, the nanoparticles were well separated; thus, the isolated nanoparticles exhibited simple diffusion, unhindered by the presence of other nanoparticles. At the highest concentration of 42%, all polymer chains were practically in direct contact with the nanoparticles; thus, the response was solely from nanoparticles with overlapping bound chains. The composite with 28% nanoparticles presented a rather “hyperdiffusive” (faster than diffusion) behavior but with faster nanoparticle relaxation times. The samples with intermediate concentrations of 8% and 17% presented the features of both dilute and concentrated polymer-nanoparticle composites. The XPCS data are plotted in Fig. 1a and 1b.', '', 'At high concentrations, the nanoparticles served as both fillers for the resulting polymer nanocomposites and probes for the viscoelasticity of the surrounding polymer medium. The slow particle motion allowed the observation of reinforcement in the nanocomposites from the “eyes” of the nanoparticles. The results from XPCS as well as rheological measurements showed that the nanoparticles unexpectedly remain mobile at high concentrations whereas the elastic modulus of the composites increases by three orders of magnitude (Fig. 1c). Such decoupling of polymer and nanoparticle dynamics has not been reported before and should lead to new experiments and simulations with potentially novel findings.

A defining feature of this class of polymers is their ability to spontaneously form exquisitely ordered structures with nanoscale periodicities, including micelles in compositionally asymmetric diblock copolymers that pack on a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. Elucidating the molecular scale dynamics that govern the properties of these materials is necessary for commercial applications but challenging due to spatiotemporal limitations of conventional instrumentation.

The autocorrelation functions were categorized, and dynamic information was extracted according to corresponding mathematical routines. Individual experiments were conducted in this way many times over the course of nucleation and growth of the BCC polycrystal, thus enabling a time-resolved perspective of this process. Long after the nucleation and initial growth of the polycrystalline BCC structure, we observed a temperature-independent structural relaxation mode that is associated with grain rotation during coarsening. Additionally, definitive evidence of internally referenced heterodyne correlations (see illustration inset) enabled quantitative extraction of particle speeds in these samples, ranging from 0.001 nm/s to 1.5 nm/s, which are attributed to grain boundary migration and cooperative particle movement.', '', 'The XPCS setup enabled high spatial resolution at wavevectors that were commensurate with the BCC lattice constant while providing precise temperature control, features that were specifically beneficial to this study.

The authors demonstrate an accurate and easy-to-implement technique that allows both optimized positioning of existing optics and provides quantitative feedback that can guide improved fabrication procedures for future optics.', '', 'One application of existing and new high-brightness x-ray sources is to focus x-ray beams into small, nanosized spots. The small spots can then be used to make spatially resolved measurements of samples in order to better understand the unique properties of materials at the nanoscale. To create such small spots requires an x-ray optic to modify the phase profile of the x-ray beam in a specific way. Imperfections or aberrations in the realized optic will, however, prevent the user from obtaining the smallest spots possible.', '', 'Measuring the wavefront (a surface of points having the same phase) is a common method at optical wavelengths for testing the quality of surfaces and evaluating the overall performance and alignment of complicated imaging systems. If accurately measured, the deviation of the wavefront from an ideal sphere provides a quantitative map of the aberrations induced by manufacturing errors and/or misalignment.', '', 'Aberrations are deviations from the perfect phase profile and can distort and broaden the focused spot. They arise from either the misalignment of the optic or they can be \"baked-in\" as a result of imperfect fabrication of the optic or from these two effects combined. As desired spot sizes become smaller, the aberrations need to be made correspondingly smaller. Clearly, the ability to accurately measure these aberrations is critical to realizing the full potential of bright x-ray sources to investigate materials at the nanoscale.', '', 'Currently, the most widely used method of x-ray-optics performance characterization is a series of knife-edge scans at different distances from the optic. From such measurements, one can extract the best focal spot size and distance. This method, however, does not contain direct information on the aberrations and is slow. In a recent publication, the authors describe a new application of so-called phase retrieval methods to determine the aberrations of hard x-ray optics. The authors used a phase retrieval method called \"transverse translational diversity\" or TTD that has been very successfully used in X-ray imaging applications. In TTD, the x-ray field of the focusing optic is perturbed with a known object placed at a diversity of transverse positions. At each position, the corresponding diffraction intensity pattern is measured. The resulting\\xa0data allows for a more robust resolution of the ambiguities typically present in phase retrieval data, with the ambiguities being especially severe for the one-dimensional case of conventional phase retrieval. The measured data is quickly processed using a computer algorithm to obtain the x-ray wavefront aberrations. This, in turn, can be used to optimize the alignment of the existing optic on-line or to improve the manufacture of future optics.', '', 'To test this new method, the researchers deliberately introduced an aberration into their focusing set-up by rotating a one-dimensional-focusing kinoform x-ray optic away from its optimal position. Since the aberrations created by the rotation can be accurately predicted, the authors had a tool to evaluate the accuracy of their wavefront measurement. As described in detail in their paper, the new method is found to be rapid, accurate, and robust.', '', 'As well as providing quantitative information on the wavefront aberrations produced by imperfect x-ray optics, the authors’ approach has other key advantages. First, the measurements can be performed at the desired operating wavelength for the x-ray optic. Consequently, the new method is a direct measurement of actual optics performance, rather than an extrapolation derived from other measurement methods which are more constrained in choice of wavelength. Second, the new method facilitates the alignment of samples. Instead of making iterative measurements of the field profile at different distances from the focusing optic in order to find the optimum location for the sample, the phase retrieval measurement can be done at one distance. Computer-based propagation methods can them be used to predict the field at all other distances and, hence, predict the distance where the best focus occurs, and the size and profile of this best focus. A third advantage is that the known perturbing object can be located far from the focus. This allows optimization of the focusing optic without the need to disturb sensitive samples and sample environments located at the x-ray-beam focus.', '', 'See: Manuel Guizar-Sicairos1‡*, Suresh Narayanan2, Aaron Stein3, Meredith Metzler4, Alec R.

That's the case with technologically valuable soft materials that undergo dynamic arrest such as gels, glasses, and emulsions, and which display very complicated relaxation behavior. A team of investigators used the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) for their studies of the detailed microscopic dynamics of relaxation in a model soft gel, establishing a previously elusive connection between the rearrangement events occurring on the microscopic scale and the observable stress relaxation behavior on the macroscale. The work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, provides a deeper understanding of the origins of the microscopic motions inside soft materials, and their connection to macroscopic physical properties such as the “softness” of a gel. \", '', 'One of the major challenges in studying the microscopic motion of particles inside soft materials has been the phenomenon of “rheological aging”. This is a process in which the constant thermal motion of the constituent particles causes a slow change in the internal structure and thus the property of a material (for a familiar example of this, consider the yogurt in your fridge which gradually expels a watery layer as it ages and becomes stiffer and denser, a process also known as syneresis). Aging processes are known to produce highly complex microscopic dynamics inside soft materials that mask the motion of particles in their stationary or “quiescent” states. Thus, the research team designed a soft gel material in which this aging effect was suppressed, and this allowed them to study the internal motions of the gel in a quiescent state as well as in response to controlled perturbations. ', '', 'To study this model gel material, the researchers combined rheological studies with ultra-small angle x-ray scattering (USXAS) at the APS X-ray Science Division (XSD) Chemical & Materials Science’s Group’s 9-ID beamline and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at the XSD Dynamics & Structure Group’s 8-ID-I beamline also at the APS, an Office of Science user facility at Argonne National Laboratory. Synchrotron x-ray scattering techniques avoid the limitations of visible-light studies and provide a key advantage for the team’s research due to the high electron density contrast between the nanoparticles, polymers, and water medium. ', '', 'The fact that many soft materials show a complex broad distribution of stress relaxation times when viewed from the macroscopic perspective is well-established (and is also displayed in the team’s non-aging sample). However, the connection of these observations to microscopic-scale relaxation behaviors has been hard to pin down. To address this, the team performed XPCS studies on a quiescent material gelled in a capillary in situ and demonstrated that “superdiffusive” dynamics were prevalent throughout the microstructure, i.e., material elements in the relaxing gel moved faster than that predicted by the classical law of Fickian diffusion. This signified the release of internal stresses built up in the gel during dynamic arrest. ', '', 'By carefully comparing measurements over a range of temperatures, the team found that the timescale of this superdiffusive process was equivalent to the mean timescale of macroscopic stress relaxation in the gels, a result consistent with the idea that the microscopic origins of stress relaxation lie in the constant rearrangements occurring inside the microstructure which are dictated by internal states of stress. They also showed that these stresses are anisotropic, resulting in faster relaxation processes near the walls constraining the gel which prevent the relaxation of internal stress during gelation. Overall, these observations confirm that trapped local stresses within the gel clusters drive relaxation at macroscopic scales as well.', '', 'The team also found that the microscopic relaxation times of the gel in the quiescent state exhibited a Gaussian distribution, which was inconsistent with the complex non-Gaussian distribution of stress relaxation times observed macroscopically. Therefore, the investigators decided to check for perturbation-induced effects on the macroscopic relaxation process. To do so, the team induced an approximately 10% compressive strain on the gel sample inside an aluminum cell holder and performed XPCS on these compressed gels. The team found that the compressed gel exhibited significantly different microscopic dynamics than was observed in the quiescent state. Whereas the quiescent state resulted in temporally homogeneous relaxation dynamics, the perturbed state resulted in highly intermittent instantaneous dynamics (Fig. 1). By tracking the distribution of intermittent fluctuations in the perturbed sample, the team found that the fluctuations exhibited highly non-Gaussian statistics at short times (in a similar vein to the non-Gaussian distribution of stress relaxation times observed at the macroscopic scale) before reverting to Gaussian statistics at longer time scales approaching the mean microscopic relaxation time. This shows that quiescent internal stress relaxation is not enough to account for the broad range of stress relaxation processes in these arrested soft materials, because some form of perturbation at the microscale is required to trigger a broader distribution of stress relaxation times.\\xa0 \\xa0', '', 'With these experiments, the team has demonstrated a link between the very small and the very large worlds of dynamically arrested soft materials. What may appear to be simple linear viscoelastic behavior on the macroscale is governed by a complex set of dynamical behaviors at the microscale. The researchers suggest that combining in situ measurements of microscopic relaxation processes induced by other types of small-scale perturbation events together with bulk macroscopic stress relaxation behavior (especially with the imminent arrival of higher-intensity x-rays from the upgraded APS) could reveal even more intriguing insights into physics of arrested soft materials.\\xa0\\xa0 ― Mark Wolverton, Jake Song, and Gareth H.
