## General information for nano-diffraction and nano-fluorescence imaging
"""
Nano-Diffraction Images:
In the nano-diffraction image, we expect to see a few bright spots. 
They correspond to particles that diffract at this diffraction condition. 
Those are the particles we are interested in measuring. The brighter the spot, the better for further analysis.

Nano-Fluorescence Images:
In the nano-fluorescence image, we expect to see a lot of bright areas that look like clusters of bright spots of more than 10x10 micro meter. 
We should avoid bright areas that look like clusters of bright spots of more than 10x10 micro meter  to ensure we measure single, non-clustered particles.
All particles will fluoresce regardless of the diffraction condition, so we see all the particles at the same time, 
and not just the one that diffract in the nano-diffraction image. 
The particles tend to coalesce and form clusters of bright spots of more than 10x10 micro meter we observe the nano-fluorescence image. 
We want to avoid those areas because we would like to measure isolated particles (particles that are not clustered with others). 
Also the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the thickness of the clusters, and we want to avoid the areas with a thicker layer of
particles which are brighter on the nano-fluorescence image. 

We should identify isolated and avoid bright areas the better for further analysis. When you find the possition 
of the bright spot on the difraction image or when you find the possition of the clusters to avoid on the fluoresence image
the precision of possition should be on the order of 1um.
